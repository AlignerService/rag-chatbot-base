      "text": "PREFACE Why This Book? The field of orthodontics is evolving, and general practitioners are increasingly taking on orthodontic treatments, particularly with clear aligners. Sometimes, clear aligner therapy is the sole treatment provided to a patient, but more often, it forms part of a comprehensive treatment plan. We wrote this book to guide general practitioners in successfully implementing clear aligner therapy in their practices, avoiding the common pitfalls we encountered along the way. Our Journey with Clear Aligners In 2008, we were among the first general dental offices in Denmark to be introduced to Invisalign. At that time, the system had many limitations and could not perform the complex movements possible today. Our initial cases often combined fixed appliances with Invisalign, aligning with our patients' desire for \"invisible\" braces. Many colleagues thought we were crazy to attempt orthodontic treatment as general dentists, especially with adult patients. And to be fair, moving teeth predictably is challenging. However, due to our rural location, many patients preferred not to travel two hours to see an orthodontist for regular adjustments. We also had specific expectations for orthodontic outcomes, rooted in the principles of functional occlusion from the Pankey Institute in the United States. This approach was not widely known in Scandinavia at the time, making our journey even more challenging. But our vision was clear: to treat all our patients to the best of our ability, which meant incorporating orthodontics into our restorative workflow. The Challenges We Faced When we first began treating patients with clear aligners, there was no established guidance. Despite our extensive knowledge in orthodontics and experience with fixed appliances, we had to navigate the unknown through trial and error. It is no surprise that we faced our share of failures. However, with the advancements in technology - particularly in materials and software used for virtual treatment planning - clear aligners have become more versatile and effective. Yet, they are not a “quick fix.” They require a comprehensive understanding of orthodontics, the ability to modify virtual treatment plans, and the skills to manage deviations from the plan. What This Book Offers This book is designed to provide you with practical, step-by-step guidance on successfully incorporating clear aligner therapy into your general dental practice. Whether you are new to aligners or looking to refine your expertise, this book breaks down complex orthodontic concepts into actionable strategies you can implement immediately. We believe that any general practice can safely integrate clear aligner therapy with the right knowledge and protocols. As your team becomes more familiar with orthodontics, you will better identify and diagnose patients who would benefit from such treatments. Some of these patients may need to be referred to an orthodontist, but all will benefit from comprehensive care and tailored treatment recommendations. With this knowledge, you’ll be able to make informed decisions that 11 maximise patient outcomes and maintain the highest standards of care. You'll learn how to select the right cases, use diagnostic tools effectively, and create treatment plans that are both realistic and predictable. We also cover the nuances of various clear aligner systems - including Invisalign, ClearCorrect, Spark and SureSmile - so you can confidently navigate different platforms. Beyond clinical techniques, we offer insights into patient communication, practice management, and troubleshooting common issues, ensuring that you are fully equipped to deliver comprehensive, high-quality care. Ultimately, this book empowers you to expand your services, improve patient outcomes, and elevate your practice’s success. About the Authors Balancing the demands of running a successful dental practice in two locations while raising a family made it clear that excelling in every area of dentistry was not only impossible but also unnecessary. Jesper chose to specialise in functional occlusion, aesthetic restorative dentistry, and practice leadership, while Helle focused on dental implants, orthodontics, and optimising clinical systems. Over time, our practice became renowned for its comprehensive approach to treatment, resulting in a growing number of colleagues entrusting us with their most complex cases. Helle transitioned from clinical dentistry to serve as a clinical advisor at Align Technology and later at ClearCorrect, where she honed her expertise in aligner therapy. Today, she is recognised as one of Europe’s leading authorities in clear aligner therapy, standing among a select few globally recognised experts with such a background. Since founding AlignerService, we have applied our deep expertise with Invisalign and ClearCorrect to support dentists globally, reaching clients across multiple continents, including Europe, North America, parts of Asia, and Australia. This worldwide presence has allowed us to integrate a diverse range of clear aligner systems, such as Spark, SureSmile, TrioClear, and Angel Aligners. As a result, we have personally provided over 18,000 virtual treatment plans, trained more than 3,000 professionals in clear aligner use, and contributed to advancements in aligner software and treatment techniques, helping to elevate the standard of care on a global scale. Additionally, our team of expert dentists and orthodontists spans three time zones, ensuring round-the-clock support and expertise for our global clientele. How to Use This Book This book is designed to be your comprehensive guide to mastering clear aligner therapy in your general dental practice. By reading and referring to it throughout your clinical journey, you will gain the knowledge needed to collect accurate diagnostic data, identify potential challenges early, and know when to seek expert support. We provide you with step-by-step tools to confidently diagnose orthodontic cases, create and customise treatment plans, and navigate the complexities of clear aligner systems. You’ll learn how to modify digital setups, troubleshoot issues, and ensure successful outcomes. From patient selection to final retainer delivery, this book equips you to deliver, monitor, and complete clear aligner treatments with precision and predictability. A Comprehensive Guide We will guide you through the use of four major systems: Invisalign, ClearCorrect, SureSmile, and Spark. Additionally, we will cover essential 12 orthodontic theory, principles of biomechanics, and the clinical aspects of treatment. From start to finish, you will learn how to integrate clear aligners into your practice effectively and confidently. Final Thought Like all the stories in this book, the following accounts are based on real events, though the names and specific details have been changed to protect privacy and confidentiality. \"There are no quick fixes in orthodontics.\" 13 INTRODUCTION Purpose of this book The purpose of this book is to empower general dentists with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to successfully integrate clear aligner therapy into their practices. As clear aligners continue to revolutionise orthodontic care, there is a growing opportunity for general practitioners to expand their services, enhance patient satisfaction, and improve clinical outcomes. Drawing on our extensive experience and expertise, we provide a comprehensive guide that covers every aspect of clear aligner therapy - from patient selection and diagnostic protocols to treatment planning and management of complications. Our aim is to help you navigate the complexities of clear aligner therapy, avoid common pitfalls, and achieve predictable, high-quality results.",

The 6 phases of successful clear aligner implementation 1.Workflow 2.Diagnostics 3.Treatment planning 4.Setup modification 5.Patient communication 6.Practice development In 2020 we were contacted by a colleague who was experiencing some challenges with a clear aligner treatment on one of his loyal patients. The teeth did not move as the virtual treatment plan illustrated on the computer screen. The doctor wanted our opinion about what could be done to fix the problem in a hurry. The patient had already been through 50+ sets of aligners, including 2 sets of additional aligners (revisions). Now both the patient and the doctor were becoming impatient and wondered why the bite did not yet fit at all. The doctor blamed the aligner company for not delivering a product of decent quality and the patient just wanted to finish the treatment. Looking at the initial photos and the virtual treatment plan it quickly became evident, that the doctor had started a clear aligner treatment on a patient needing orthognathic surgery. The treatment had been going on for so long, that it was impossible to go back and there was no way the treatment could be finished with clear aligners. The only way to solve the problem would be a lengthy treatment with both fixed braces and surgery. A treatment that would last an additional 1,5 years. Adult orthodontics and clear aligner treatments in particular are becoming more and more popular. In our opinion, this kind of treatment is not just a field for the orthodontic specialists. General practitioners are able to introduce clear aligner therapy in their practices as well. Currently, we are already seeing more doctors doing more and more aligner treatments all over the world. 14 This is not to say every dental office should offer clear aligner treatments to its patients. Clear aligner systems, such as Invisalign have played a big part in introducing orthodontic treatment to general practitioners all over the globe. Today many different companies offer clear aligners to dentists. In addition, we are also seeing more and more direct-to-consumer offerings popping up. It's crucial for dentists to recognise that clear aligner treatments rank among the most intricate procedures in the dental field. Across many countries, regulations remain consistent: while general dentists are permitted to undertake a wide array of treatments, the treating dentist assumes complete responsibility for the outcome. In the event of malpractice, the treatment is evaluated as if it were administered by an orthodontist. This underscores the significance of understanding this responsibility, especially in the context of potential legal actions. Put simply, the expectation is that a general dentist must possess equivalent knowledge to an orthodontist when performing orthodontic treatments. Thus, the dentist bears the full weight of responsibility for the treatment's success and any associated consequences. An important detail Clear aligner companies exclusively provide a piece of dental design software online and produce the aligners according to the dentist's instructions.",

      "text": "In addition, they help their customers (dentists) align teeth according to a standard protocol, that makes it easier for the dentist to make the necessary changes needed to create a realistic and predictable virtual treatment plan. Once the dentist has finalised the digital setup, provided by the aligner company, and is satisfied with the virtual treatment plan, the clear aligners are produced as ordered by the dentist. This means that if a treatment goes wrong, the dentist cannot blame the aligner company. The aligner company is only providing the doctor with a removable orthodontic appliance. How this appliance is being designed and used is the responsibility of the treating doctor. The aligner companies do NOT use trained orthodontists to design the digital setups. The aligner technicians designing the virtual plans rarely have any clinical experience. Most often they do not even have a dental background at all. The aligner companies have both internal and external experts that they consult. However, these experts are helping the aligner companies with the design of treatment protocols, treatment sequences, timing of movements, etc. But these experts do NOT perform any treatment planning on other patients than their own. All the virtual plans that are being presented on the computer screens by the aligner companies (digital setups) are either created by a computer or by an aligner technician (The aligner technicians simply follow the protocols set by the company and are not supposed to think by themselves). As a consequence, all digital setups should be controlled and modified by a dentist with sufficient orthodontic knowledge and experience. In this regard buying clear aligners, from a company producing clear aligners, does not differ from a company selling root canal-filling materials. These companies are not telling you how to perform every root canal treatment from start to finish. They simply provide dentists with a material, that is then to be handled by the dentist. If the endodontic treatment goes wrong it is not 15 the company that sold the root-filling material that is to blame. It is the doctor performing the clinical treatment. Fact or Fiction? Drawing from our extensive experience as clinicians and clinical advisors, we aim to address several common misunderstandings before delving deeper into the content of aligner orthodontics. We refer to this as \"myth versus reality,\" a distinction informed by the feedback we've received from numerous doctors worldwide over the past nine years. The initial digital setup has been meticulously crafted by an orthodontist and awaits your approval Unfortunately, this is not the case with any aligner company. There are several reasons for this - a major one being that the technicians (or artificial intelligence) who design the digital plans, are not clinicians and have no clinical expertise. Consequently, this deficiency can manifest in various aspects of the treatment plan, including the sequencing of treatments, placement of attachments, planning of interproximal reduction (IPR), and the aesthetic outcome of the smile, as well as the planned occlusion. In addition, there may be unpredictable movements due to biology or over-optimistic time estimates. Clinically this may result in teeth not tracking according to the virtual treatment plan. As the treating doctor, you carry the full responsibility for the aligner treatment. Therefore it is important to remember, that anything is possible on the computer when designing the virtual treatment plan. As the treating doctor, you need to make sure that the virtual treatment plan is clinically realistic and predictable. You do not just want an animated treatment plan that looks great on a computer screen but does not give you the desired clinical result.",

      "text": "A diagnosis is either present or not, making the process relatively straightforward once you are familiar with all the diagnoses and diagnostic criteria. However, treatment planning is unique for each patient, as every individual presents distinct characteristics and needs. Additionally, each dentist has their own treatment preferences, further contributing to the variability in treatment plans. You already know that when you ask 20 dentists to create a treatment plan based on a set of bitewing x-rays you will get 20 different treatment plans. Now imagine asking 20 doctors about a treatment plan for a patient in need of orthodontic treatment or maybe even an ortho-restorative treatment. In this case, you have images, x-rays and an IO-scan of up to 32 teeth. Do we need to point out that in these instances you will receive 40 different treatment plans or more! That is why we can not use a standard protocol for orthodontic treatment planning. This is also one of the reasons artificial intelligence and technicians following standard protocols are only able to help us some of the way towards the desired clinical end result. To ensure that what you see on the screen translates accurately into real-life outcomes, you need to have a thorough understanding of tooth movements, biomechanics, anchorage, biotype, interproximal reduction (IPR), and the placement of attachments/engagers. By viewing the digital treatment setups provided by aligner companies as an initial and basic framework that always requires modification, you 16 will be in a much better position to assess and edit digital setups effectively. This approach ensures the plans are both realistic and predictable while aligning with your individual treatment preferences. All movements are the same The teeth all have different shapes and sizes. In addition, the bone and the soft tissue surrounding them have different characteristics. As a consequence, they need different types of forces to move. If we add the same type and amount of force to all types of teeth, we should not expect to get the same kinds of movements expressed clinically on all the teeth. The amount and placement of force depend on the desired movement of the teeth. Additionally, the biology of the surrounding bone and soft tissue plays a crucial role. These factors necessitate planning different attachments/engagers and varying the speed of tooth movements to achieve more predictable treatment results. Teeth on which we plan major root movements are more difficult to move and need different staging and sequencing of the movements compared to teeth that might only need a simple tipping movement. Major root movements will be less predictable and have a higher risk of tracking issues. This does not mean we should avoid these kinds of movements but rather encourages us to look at aligner treatments more comprehensively. Space between the teeth is necessary to facilitate tooth movement. By correctly staging planned movements and adding interproximal reduction (IPR) at the appropriate time, the predictability of tooth movements can be enhanced. Additionally, incorporating attachments/engagers or other auxiliaries can further improve the predictability of specific tooth movements. No matter how meticulously treatments are planned, tracking issues should always be expected and accepted as a normal part of the process. This is no different from other types of orthodontic treatments, where adjustments are often necessary. When issues arise, the plan is simply adjusted and new aligners are ordered. Though it requires a bit of extra time, it is similar to an orthodontist needing to change a wire, add a coil, or modify a wire to achieve the desired tooth movement. The key is to diagnose deviations from the plan, make the necessary adjustments, and continue the treatment. It's important to remember that biological factors are beyond our control, regardless of our efforts. You can confidently do clear aligner treatments after a one-day course After a one-day course, you will know what kind of materials and records you need to collect, how to upload diagnostic materials and records to your clear aligner doctor portal, how to use the aligner software, and how to initiate a treatment. However, such a course provides only a very limited amount of orthodontic knowledge necessary for diagnosing, selecting the right patients, planning and treating patients orthodontically. It is of course impossible to transfer all the knowledge needed to perform an ideal orthodontic treatment using clear aligners in one, two or three days. Digital technology has advanced to a level, where it is possible to help doctors with the initial stages of clear aligner treatment planning. However, it can not replace orthodontic knowledge and experience. There is in fact a reason why it takes 3-4 years to become an orthodontist. 17 All aligner systems are the same There are various clear aligner systems available, and while they all rely on basic orthodontic principles to move teeth, they differ in software, design, materials, and production methods. It takes time, practice, and knowledge to become proficient with each system due to these variations. However, once you understand how a specific clear aligner system works, you can apply your orthodontic knowledge to create a predictable treatment plan that will be effective with your chosen system (QR 2-1). Whether you use metal brackets and wires or plastic aligners, teeth do not recognise what is causing them to move. If the treating doctor knows how to effectively use their chosen orthodontic system - whether brackets and wires or clear aligners - and can apply their knowledge of orthodontics, biomechanics, and anchorage, they can achieve the desired movements with almost any appropriate type of orthodontic appliance. \"Appropriate\" means selecting the right type of apparatus for the specific tooth movements needed. Clear aligners excel at certain types of movements, while fixed appliances are more effective for others. Ultimately, choosing the appropriate orthodontic appliance is more about the practitioner's knowledge than the system or appliance itself. You do not need to know the malocclusion/diagnosis to move teeth with clear aligners Regardless of industry assertions, aligner therapy is an orthodontic treatment that necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the malocclusion and all associated diagnoses before initiating any treatment. It is important to understand orthodontic possibilities and limitations to be able to make a sufficient treatment plan. Not just an orthodontic treatment plan but a comprehensive plan that includes restoring function and aesthetics correctly. Sometimes this requires surgery or restorative procedures in addition to the orthodontic treatment alone. It is important to know when it will be difficult or impossible to reach a perfect end result with clear aligners alone, and when to refer to a specialist or apply an interdisciplinary approach. The virtual treatment plan represents what will actually happen clinically When looking at the virtual treatment plan. Most of the time the end result looks really great. What we might forget to think about, is that it is a digital simulation. Everything is possible on a computer screen. The questions arise: Will it happen in reality? And if so: What are the consequences?",

A SOLID FOUNDATIONUnderstanding what drives you as a dentist, how you prefer to work, and with whom, is essential for aligning your practice with your goals and personality. Do you prefer to handle everything yourself, taking on high-risk cases, or would you rather focus on certain aspects of treatment and delegate others to colleagues? Are you more focused on providing comprehensive care or running a business efficiently? Delegation can be a valuable tool in streamlining your practice and ensuring optimal patient care. Identifying what tasks can be delegated and to whom can help you work more effectively and achieve your goals. While these questions may seem unrelated to the content of this book, they are foundational to shaping your practice and ensuring that it aligns with your values, preferences, and aspirations. Strengths and weaknesses Understanding your limitations and setting personal boundaries is crucial in orthodontics. These treatments are among the most complex in dental practice, and it's essential to recognise what you're capable of. This awareness allows you to seek assistance promptly or refer patients when necessary. Especially in the early stages, when experience with clear aligners is limited, knowing where to seek help is vital. Whether it's in patient selection, diagnosis, treatment planning, or receiving clinical guidance during treatment, having a network of support and resources to draw upon is invaluable. Important basics Working on a digital platform facilitates treatment planning, visualisation of the end result, and control over the sequence of planned movements. To effectively utilise software and aligner technicians for planning movements, high-quality digital records including clinical photos, x-rays, and intraoral scans are necessary. This data is processed by both employees of the aligner company and the practitioner. Poor-quality data often leads to poor treatment results or malpractice. Therefore, ensuring the quality of the submitted records is critical for achieving successful outcomes. In the following, we will outline: Required data:  We will specify the data necessary for clear aligner treatment planning, including clinical photos, x-rays, and intraoral scans. Purpose of the data:  We will explain the purpose of each type of data and how it contributes to the treatment planning process. Data collection guidelines:  We will provide guidance on how to collect the right data, ensuring it meets the necessary quality standards for effective treatment planning. IO-scans or PVS impressions? Certain requirements must be met for the 3D model used in treatment planning and aligner production. Precision in representing the patient's teeth and gums is crucial, as any discrepancies can impact the treatment outcome significantly. Even minor defects in the impression of the teeth can pose significant clinical challenges. This is evident when comparing intraoral scans (IO-scans) with traditional polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) impressions. Treatments based on IO-scans often proceed more smoothly due to the higher level of   25",

The requirements for both intraoral scans (IO-scans) and polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) impressions are the same: 1.All teeth in the scanned jaw must be captured fully. 2.All tooth surfaces should be intact and fully included in the impression or scan, without any defects (holes in the surface scan). 3.The scan should include at least 3 millimetres of soft tissue apical to the gingival margin. 4.IO-scans should include a bite registration. 5.For PVS impressions, no separate bite registration is necessary, as technicians align the bite based on clinical photos of the patient's bite. High-quality photos, possibly including occlusal photos with blue or green markings of occlusal contacts in maximum intercuspation, are required for this purpose. When making a digital bite registration, it's essential to observe how the patient bites together. Instructing the patient to bite down firmly on the back teeth can often yield better results. Clinical tip: Simply instructing the patient to bite together may lead to a tendency for the patient to protrude slightly. This can introduce imprecision into the digital setup from the outset, potentially causing issues with the occlusion in the virtual treatment plan right from the beginning of treatment. Therefore, clear instructions to bite down firmly on the back teeth can help ensure a more accurate digital bite registration. IO-Scans Based on our experience, treatment results based on IO-scans tend to be more predictable and precise compared to aligner treatments based on PVS impressions. An IO-scan offers superior precision compared to a typical PVS impression. Additionally, it is faster, as we can digitally control the IO-scan immediately and send it to the clear aligner company within seconds. Most scanners automatically highlight areas that have not been included in the scan, making it easy to correct by rescanning those areas. With greater precision, we obtain better models using an IO-scanner. Clinically, we have observed that clear aligners fit the patient's teeth better when using an intraoral scan. As a result, clear aligner treatments based on IO-scans tend to be more predictable and precise in their outcomes. This is probably because modern IO-scanners are able to create a much more precise digital representation of the teeth and the soft tissues compared with a PVS impression. In addition, the IO-scan will not compress soft tissue as a PVS material. This means that IO-scans give you the opportunity to work with aligners, that have a straight trim line. In most cases, a straight trim line will have a number of advantages over a scalloped trim line. The differences will be covered later in this book. With a straight trim line, the aligner material will typically cover 1-2 millimetres of the soft tissue. If the digital model in the clear aligner setup is based on a PVS impression, the soft tissue may be slightly compressed. This compression can lead to aligners exerting excessive pressure on the patient's soft tissue, potentially causing painful   26",

PVS impressions Taking a PVS impression suitable for clear aligner treatments typically requires considerably more time compared to an IO-scan. Additionally, it can be challenging to inspect PVS impressions and ensure that the quality of the impression meets the standards necessary for creating accurate clear aligners.  When sending in impressions to clear aligner companies, it's crucial to remember that they do not return the impression trays. If you use PVS impressions, make sure to: -Use single-use plastic trays for each patient. -Apply adhesive to all areas of the inside of the impression tray and 2-3 millimetres of the outside borders to enhance material retention. -Utilise a putty material with a 5-minute set time as the base material. -Insert the putty into the patient's mouth and start a 5-minute timer. -Hold the impression in place for 30 seconds before removing it. -Remove excess material extending too far palatally and into the sulcus. -Inject ultralight light body PVS impression material with a 3-3.5 minute set time into all indentations of the teeth. -Re-insert the impression into the patient's mouth, ensuring precise tray repositioning. -Allow the impression material to set until the timer rings. -Carefully inspect the impression for any air bubbles, missing detail, distortions, or visible tray material. Any imperfections can compromise the accuracy of the aligners' fit and may lead to tracking issues. -If necessary, make a new impression to ensure optimal accuracy. -Ship the impression to the aligner company for further processing. After a couple of days, the aligner company receives the PVS impressions. The impressions will be scanned. Either with x-rays or with a photo-scanner. If the aligner company detects any flaws or imperfections in an area that will be covered by aligner material. The aligner company will reject the impressions, send screenshots of the imperfections to the doctor and ask for new impressions. No matter what you tell the clear aligner company, they will not produce any clear aligners based on imperfect impressions. With good reason, as this will result in tracking issues with a 100% guarantee.  Great PVS impressions will be converted into digital 3D models that will be used in the virtual treatment planning process as well as the final production of the aligners.  By following the described steps meticulously, practitioners can strive for higher accuracy in their PVS impressions, ultimately contributing to more successful clear aligner treatments. Clinical photos In order to treatment plan a clear aligner case, we need a series of high-quality clinical photos. Three extraoral photos and five intraoral photos.  The photos are used by the technicians to set and verify the bite. To verify that the scan and the photos match and to make sure the data matches the same patient.    27\n3.

If you work with an external partner helping you with diagnostics and treatment planning. That partner needs great photos to be able to help you. As you will discover in the section about diagnostics and treatment planning. Every photo in the photo protocol is important as it will be used during the treatment planning phase in combination with the virtual setup based on the digital 3D models of the patient’s teeth.  In order to get the most out of the photos, the precision, with which the photos are being acquired, is really important. It may feel more complicated than it is.

But there are two reasons why we don't recommend mirrors for these photos: 1.It hurts the patient when we position everything correctly 2.Placing the mirror correctly, making the patient hold the retractor in an ideal way and getting the angulation and the framing correct at the same time is extremely difficult. At AlignerService we have seen images from more than 2000 different practices. Based on our observations we recommend you do not use a mirror. (The only exceptions are images we receive from most orthodontists. Because they take these photos several times every single day) Consider this: When we take photos of a patient. Most often the patient has not yet approved any kind of treatment plan. If we give the patient a painful experience while taking the photos. How motivated do you think the patient will be to accept treatment later? A painful experience during photography can create a subconscious mental anchor for the patients. They may begin to question the potential discomfort of future treatments, leading to thoughts like, \"If a non-invasive procedure prior to treatment hurts like this, how will the treatment itself feel?” It's challenging to talk patients out of these concerns once they've formed. Instead, it's crucial to address potential challenges proactively. That's why we recommend taking buccal photos without a mirror. Simply ensure the camera is correctly positioned in relation to the first molar for optimal results and patient comfort. 30 3. A SOLID FOUNDATION Occlusal photos: (Fig 3-3) Requirements -The occlusal photo should always be taken with a high-quality mirror, reflecting an undistorted image of all the teeth. We recommend using a titanium mirror with a handle mounted to the mirror as this makes mirror handling a lot easier. -Always use retractors for the occlusal photos. If no retractors are used, the soft tissue will collapse around the mirror and obstruct the view. In addition, the facial surfaces and potentially the incisal edges of the teeth will be covered. We find the best retractor for this is the 1/4 self-retracting retractor. This particular retractor can be held with one hand by the patient, retracts the lips perfectly and leaves plenty of space for the mirror. -Frame the image in a way that mirror edges and lips are minimised. The nose of the patient and unreflected teeth should not be visible in the image. -Take the image in a way that makes it look as if you are angled 90 degrees to the occlusal surfaces. Show as many teeth as possible. All of the first molars have to be included as well as all anterior teeth. With the right angulation both the facial and oral surfaces of the incisors should be visible. -Always remember to flip and turn photos taken with a mirror. If not you will have photos that are potentially useless to work with once you start working on your virtual treatment plan. Even the best photos will be almost useless if they are arranged in the wrong way. With a full series of great clinical photos, we are able to proceed to the next step in the treatment planning process (Fig 3-4). The importance of high-quality clinical photos cannot be overstated. When evaluating the treatment setup, these photos are essential for determining if the plan is clinically realistic, safe, predictable, and achievable.",

This is important in case you discover external resorptions during treatment (control X-rays should be made 3 months into treatment to ensure a healthy progression of treatment). Lateral ceph. (Fig 3-7) A cephalometric X-ray is necessary when conducting a cephalometric analysis, which is crucial in children with growing jaws and adult patients requiring orthognathic surgery. However, for adult patients suitable for clear aligner treatment in a general practice, a cephalometric X-ray is considered optional in most cases. This is because a thorough evaluation can often be accomplished with a good profile photo and great 33 Fig 3-5 Panoramic X-ray (OPG) Fig 3-6 Intraoral X-ray Fig 3-7 Lateral ceph. 3. A SOLID FOUNDATIONbuccal photos of the patient. These images can help assess whether the patient has a skeletal or dental deviation, determining the need for surgery. If surgery is deemed necessary, the patient should be referred to an orthodontist or maxillofacial surgeon, who will collaborate with an orthodontist to devise a treatment plan. Prescription form - Basic requirements The next step for the technician to create the initial treatment setup involves receiving detailed instructions on your envisioned end result for the planned clear aligner treatment. These instructions are submitted via the prescription form. Before filling out a prescription form, it is imperative to have a well-defined orthodontic or ortho-restorative treatment plan. You need to know the end result you are striving for. If you are unclear about your goals, no one else will be able to deliver a result that meets your standards - unless they happen to be very lucky. This includes clear aligner technicians, clear aligner artificial intelligence as well as orthodontic clear aligner experts you collaborate with. As the treating doctor, you bear full responsibility for the treatment. To ensure that everyone working on your case adheres to your instructions and understands your treatment plan, it is crucial to provide high-quality data. Throughout this book, you'll learn the importance of the information required to complete a prescription form. Poor quality data will typically result in a lower quality digital plan created by the clear aligner technicians. As well as any artificial intelligent treatment planning software. When filling out the prescription form, you need to inform the technicians about your diagnoses of the patient, the specific tooth movements you intend to achieve, and which teeth you plan to move versus those that should remain untouched. Additionally, you can include detailed instructions regarding any specific aspects of the treatment you want to address or maintain as they are. The clear aligner doctor portal is where you will be uploading all of that information. The doctor platform is a cloud-based data hub that allows you to collect and share all the data needed in relation to the clear aligner treatment. These data will be shared with, the aligner technician and can be shared with any collaborator you grant access to your doctor portal or parts of it. If you know how to work with clear aligners and you know your preferences, then it is fairly easy for you to fill out the clinical preferences. If you have not done many clear aligner cases, it can be very difficult to know, what your preferences are. You need to test out different things, for you to know what works for you. In other words: You need to gain experience and know your work. Our recommended clinical preferences will be shared later in this book. But as you go through the content of the book, it is our hope, that you will gradually start creating an idea about what your own clinical preferences should be. In combination with the clinical experience, you will gather as you treat your patients. Case selection (know your patient) Based on our experience, almost every doctor new to treating patients with clear aligners seeks a fast and easy protocol for case selection. While this is entirely understandable, it is also a very 34 3. A SOLID FOUNDATIONunrealistic expectation. Case selection is likely one of the most complex aspects of any clear aligner treatment. Here we will try to outline some of the most important key aspects of case selection. There are essentially two key factors to consider in any case: 1.The clinical situation 2.The mindset of the patient The clinical situation As a general dentist with an interest in orthodontics, it's not difficult to identify patients who could benefit from orthodontic treatment. Either as the only treatment or in combination with some kind of restorative procedure. The challenge comes when you need to determine if the patient is suitable for treatment with clear aligners, if the treatment is within your comfort zone or if it's a patient who should be referred to an orthodontist. With great medical records, this process becomes much easier. After treating about 500 patients with clear aligners, it becomes easy to do the case selection just by taking a look at the patient in the dental chair. Before reaching this level of experience, it is advisable to take great care in gathering as much information as possible and process it in a systematic manner. This will lead to a faster and more systematic case selection process in your practice over time. Remembering all the clinical findings can be challenging. That is why it is important to have good medical records, as this enables you to go back and have a look at the patient once the patient has left the practice. Through records such as high-quality photos, x-rays, and IO-scans, you can perform approximately 90% of your diagnostics without physically seeing the patient. This underscores the importance of capturing excellent photos and maintaining meticulous records. With comprehensive digital documentation, you can virtually \"digitalise\" the patient, allowing for seamless sharing of information with specialists globally. However, the quality of feedback you receive from the specialists you collaborate with depends not only on their competence but also, crucially, on the quality of the diagnostic materials you provide. When creating both a treatment plan and a virtual treatment plan, it is essential to always reference the patient's clinical situation. By working on the virtual setup with your diagnoses and treatment goals at hand, while also reviewing the clinical photos, you can ensure that the treatment aligns with the patient's facial and soft tissue characteristics. This integrated approach - utilising photos, X-rays, IO-scans, the patient's desires, and a visualisation of the desired end result, combined with orthodontic knowledge - enables you to create a virtual treatment plan that is clinically achievable, realistic, biologically safe, and predictably incorporates orthodontic movements and restorative procedures. Detailed guidance on how to accomplish this will be provided in the following sections.",

Detailed guidance on how to accomplish this will be provided in the following sections. The mindset of the patient Imagine this: A beautiful young woman enters your dental practice. Everything about her seems to be groomed to perfection. During your interview you discover, that she has a desire to align a rotated central incisor that seems to have rotated more and more in a distal direction. As you look into the mouth of the patient you see a clinical situation that is really, really easy to handle from an orthodontic perspective. A maxillary central incisor needs to be rotated 10 degrees to be aligned perfectly with the rest of the maxillary teeth. This makes you promise the 35 3. A SOLID FOUNDATIONpatient, that you can fix it with a 3-month clear aligner treatment. The challenge arises when the patient returns with a tooth that is aligned as planned but with a desire to have the angulation of the tooth changed just a little… You scan the patient and plan the revision… 2 months later the patient wants the angulation of the neighbouring tooth to be changed just a little as well…. you follow the patient's request and then a minor black triangle occurs… and this way you just continue treating the patient over and over and over. What started as a simple case from a clinical perspective, became a super complex case due to the expectations and the mindset of the patient. In these situations, everybody loses. When selecting patients, it is really important to consider both the clinical situation and the mindset of the patient. Sometimes you will encounter patients with clinical situations that are really easy to solve orthodontically. But as you get to know the patient and figure out the expectations and the mindset of the patient, you realise the patient has very specific requirements that may not be that easy to promise to be solved. In these cases, the patient will change from a simple case to a really complex one. Not because the treatment in itself is difficult. But because the end result, desired by the patient, can be really difficult to reach, due to the patient's expectations of perfection. In such cases, very simple orthodontic treatments can convert into really complex cases. Conversely. We have also seen patients with really challenging orthodontic conditions, that required orthognathic surgery to be solved. At least if the patients were to be brought into an ideal class I occlusion. Some of these patients were considered too old to be treated surgically. Others had a profound wish to have a nice looking smile and did not care about an open bite. In some of these situations, we have found the mindsets of the patients to be remarkably open. If these patients know and understand the consequences of the compromises involved in just treating a part of all the orthodontic conditions and by the way have a stable occlusion without any muscular or joint problems. We have experienced successful treatments that fully met the desires of the patients. To prevent unwanted, endless treatments like the one described initially. We find it important to clarify the expectations with the patients before even considering any clear aligner treatment. During your initial interview, it is important to set the right expectations.

      "text": "digital smile design. Calibrating the patient’s expectations becomes even more important. Because the simulations may induce very specific expectations in the mind of the patient. Please make sure to clarify any such expectations and inform the patient that a digital simulation rarely simulates the exact end result. Rather it illustrates kind of what is possible. You may be perfectly able to deliver what you see in the digital simulation. But sometimes you aren’t. You might come close, but it's not always a 100% perfect match to the simulation, and sometimes, it even leads to a better end result. However, if a patient has very specific ideas about the desired end result, it can lead to unpleasant situations for everyone involved in the treatment. 36 3. A SOLID FOUNDATIONIn short: Never promise the patient a specific end result. Instead, ensure that the expectations of the patients are realistic to overcome clinically. Know your work Whether you move teeth with fixed braces or removable appliances like clear aligners, the teeth will not recognise what system you use to move them. No matter how you move the teeth, they will follow some specific biological and physical rules. You may ask whether or not clear aligners or fixed appliances are equally good or bad at moving teeth. The answer to that question is not straightforward to answer. The reason is, that both types of orthodontic appliances have their strengths and weaknesses. Fixed appliances have certain advantages and disadvantages and the same is true for clear aligners. This means that the choice of orthodontic appliance should depend on the individual case and not necessarily the desire of the patient. That being said it is theoretically possible to achieve the same treatment results with clear aligners as with fixed appliances. However, it may take a lot longer to achieve the same results depending on the planned movements. With this in mind, it is important to remember, that clear aligners are just a tool in the orthodontic treatment toolbox. Just like other removable appliances or fixed appliances. It is not the system itself that is able to move the teeth. The teeth will move into a desired position as a consequence of the deliberate application of carefully planned forces. This applies to all orthodontic appliances. What differentiates clear aligners from the other orthodontic appliances is, that the treatment planning software enables you to see the end result and the planned movements. Most dentists treating patients with fixed appliances have an idea about the desired end result in their heads. However, that end result may change over time, as the treatment progresses and the biological challenges start to appear. With clear aligner software illustrating the desired treatment outcome and all the planned steps from the starting point until the final stage of treatment. This may mislead you to believe, that what you see on the screen will happen in reality. We recommend being very cautious about this as most problems in clear aligner treatments happen when you trust the software and the technicians designing the initial treatment proposal. Before beginning any clear aligner treatment, it is essential to consider the following: •All relevant diagnoses •The patient's desires and expectations •The specific treatment goals •The type of treatment required to achieve these goals •The most suitable orthodontic appliance for the task •The potential drawbacks of choosing clear aligners if traditional braces may be a more appropriate option Most often we choose to treat adult patients with clear aligners because this is what the patients are demanding. And honestly - we find that to be ok. At least most of the time. Because the alternative will often be, that the patients opt out of orthodontic treatment.",

Are clear aligners as good or better than brackets and wires? Sometimes but not always. 37 3. A SOLID FOUNDATIONThe thing is, applying forces to the teeth makes them move. Whether the force is coming from brackets and wires, clear aligners, muscles, lips, cheeks or bad habits, does not really matter. Teeth don't distinguish where the forces that move them come from. The success of orthodontic tooth movements relies less on the type of appliance employed and more on how we plan the treatment, execute the treatment plan and utilise the chosen appliances. Biomechanics indeed holds a crucial role. Not only in treatments with fixed appliances but also in all clear aligner treatments. Understanding both the biological aspects and biomechanics is essential for assessing the feasibility of planned tooth movements. It ensures that we apply the appropriate amount of force to move a tooth in a specific direction effectively and safely. Once you have performed your orthodontic examination, collected all the data and added it to your medical records you can upload the data to your clear aligner doctor portal and start working on the virtual treatment plan. Starting a new case Collect the Patient Informed Consent Before proceeding with creating an order, it's crucial to have your patient read and sign a Patient Informed Consent form. Many clear aligner companies provide a standard consent form that covers ALL aspects related to clear aligner treatment. It's important for your patients to understand the risks and benefits of clear aligner therapy. You will typically be able to download an example form from your clear aligner software platform. However, in many countries outside the United States of America, these standard forms can be overwhelming for patients and may deter them from starting treatment. The form should adhere to all local laws in your area but it is advisable to modify the consent form to your personal preferences as well. Keep the signed document for your records. In order to start treating a patient with clear aligners, you will have to create an order in the doctor platform software of your preferred clear aligner provider. Start the submission online Every clear aligner system has its own unique way to create a new case. In general, the patient is created in the doctor portal, with the patient information: •Name •Date of birth •Gender Duration of treatment Even if you possess the capacity to define the duration of treatment, we strongly advise against exercising that authority. Aligning expectations with the patient is already a formidable task. Introducing constraints on the duration of treatment can lead to numerous compromises that could be avoided without such limitations. While individuals with over 100 clear aligner treatments under their belt may opt to utilise this option, it is not our recommended course of action. Wear Schedule The wear schedule defines the time your patient will be wearing the aligners before changing to the next set of aligners. The standard wear time is 14 days per aligner. 38 3. A SOLID FOUNDATIONWhen starting out treating patients with clear aligners, we recommend you use the standard wear schedule of your chosen clear aligner brand. Once your patient gets accustomed to wearing clear aligners, you find the patient is compliant and the movements track as planned. The patient may be ready to change the wear schedule. After 20+ cases and additional studies, you will probably start to recognise challenging movements that may require a two-week wear schedule. However, you will also know when the patient has a period with simple movements, that could be completed with a 10 or 7-day wear schedule. Studies have shown that wear schedules shorter than two weeks may result in less accurate tooth movements (Depending on the tooth movement velocity of the planned movements and the aligner material). We do recognise that this may be the case if you follow the standard protocols of the clear aligner companies. We believe you will be able to achieve more predictable results if you optimise your virtual treatment plan by decreasing the forces applied in each aligner and thereby work with a lower but more continuous force. This approach favours a more frequent change of aligners (typically weekly) but also places significantly greater demands on the way the virtual treatment plan is planned and staged. Please note that for the first 4 weeks, patients should only change their aligner every 2 weeks. This will be described in more detail later. Specifically for ClearCorrect users ClearCorrect aims to reduce plastic consumption and minimise environmental impact during the production of their clear aligners. To achieve this, they produce only 12 sets of aligners at a time, which are dispatched to the dental practice according to the selected wear schedule. If you decide to modify the wear schedule, ClearCorrect must adjust the production plan to ensure the next set of aligners arrives on time for your patient's treatment. If you choose to change the wear schedule during treatment, it is important to promptly contact your local ClearCorrect representative so they can update the manufacturing dates accordingly. Data uploading In the next phase of the prescription form, you will typically have to upload the photos, x-rays and the IO-scans. If you use a photo app developed by the aligner company to take the clinical photos, the photos should already be uploaded, mirrored, flipped and positioned correctly. Make sure that all your photos are rotated, flipped and mirrored correctly before you upload them to the doctor portal. If the photos are not aligned correctly, you will have a hard time using them during the treatment planning process. X-rays should represent the actual situation and not be older than 6 months. IO-scans will typically be uploaded directly to your doctor portal when you have a direct integration between your scanner and the clear aligner software platform. If you do not have this kind of integration, make sure you reach out to your clear aligner provider and have them help you with this. (It makes this process really simple and decreases the risk of mixing up patient data). 39 3. A SOLID FOUNDATIONThe majority of clear aligner companies accept STL files from various scanner brands for use in their software platforms. However, Invisalign stands out by limiting their platform exclusively to their own scanners. While a few older scanner brands are still compatible with Invisalign, it is anticipated that eventually only their proprietary iTero scanners will be supported. From Revisions to Results Do you recall the Norwegian colleague who encountered numerous revisions in his clear aligner treatments, deviating from the intended virtual plans? Upon recognising his orthodontic limitations, he embarked on enhancing his fundamental orthodontic knowledge while also training his team. Collaborating with his team and Helle, the doctor devised a workflow enabling greater control over treatments.",

ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONThere are 3 general parts of the orthodontic assessment: 1.The patient dental and medical history 2.The extraoral assessment 3.The intraoral assessment Below we have elaborated on which examinations must be performed and documented. In the following, we describe in detail how to perform these examinations yourself and what impact they have or can have on your subsequent virtual treatment plan. The patient dental and medical history must contain: -Patient name -Date of birth -The desires of the patient -Dental history including traumas -Medical history -Oral habits In addition, we like to include a short checklist reminding us to make sure the following important information has been obtained: -Clinical photos -X-rays (Panoramic and anterior teeth) -IO-scan The extraoral assessment -Profile view -AP relation -Mandibular plane angle -Vertical relations -Nasolabial angle -E line -Frontal view -Vertical relations -Dental labial analysis -Tooth exposure at rest -Smile line -Lip line -Smile width -Labial corridors -Dental line vs. facial midline -Occlusal plane -Muscles (Visual & Palpation) -Temporomandibular joints (Sound & Palpation) The intraoral assessment -The periodontal health -Crowding/Spacing -Bolton analysis -Overjet & Overbite -Curve off spee -Angle classification/molar and canine relations -Dental midline -Anterior crossbite -Posterior crossbite -Rotations -Static occlusion -Functional occlusion -Radiographs The dental and medical history Patient expectations In order to treat the patient and gain the needed patient commitment during treatment. It is important to find out what the patient desires. -What is the main complaint of the patient? -What is the motivation for treatment? -What are the expectations of the patient? (The aesthetic and functional end result and the treatment - Be aware of unrealistic expectations). 47 4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONOral habits: Untouched the teeth will always position themselves in a perfect balance between the forces affecting them. The tongue will push the teeth in a buccal direction. The lips and cheeks will push the teeth in a lingual direction. Over time these dynamics change. The muscles change in size and strength. The patient may develop certain habits, that can affect this dynamic environment as well. Does the patient have any oral habits? It is really important to identify these before starting treatment. If you align the teeth of the patient absolutely perfect and the patient has a habit of biting on a pen with the anterior teeth all the time. Even though you have the best type of retention, the teeth may move due to the habit. If this happens you will probably be met by a dissatisfied patient wanting you to treat the relapse for free. Any oral habits that may impact the treatment process should be identified prior to starting any orthodontic treatment. Some habits need to be addressed prior to treatment. Some can be affected during treatment. Nail biting, for instance, is incompatible with clear aligners. While this habit doesn't directly impede treatment, it can potentially affect the duration for which the patient wears the aligners. One silver lining is that wearing clear aligners makes it impossible to bite one's nails. As a result, a positive side effect is that nail biters often cease their nail-biting habit. If the patient is willing to quit this habit, clear aligner treatment can aid not only in aligning the teeth but also in breaking the habit. However, if the patient chooses to persist with nail-biting, it could prolong wear time for the clear aligners and consequently, hinder the treatment progress. Some patients have a bad habit of biting on things like a pen for instance. Constantly biting a pen or a toothpick can move the teeth like an orthodontic appliance. Open bites There is always some sort of tongue habit that needs to be addressed in patients with open bites. Anterior open bites Patients with anterior open bites have to place their tongue between the teeth in order to swallow. If they don’t the food or liquid in their mouth will be pushed out between the teeth and potentially out of the mouth during swallowing. Posterior open bites Constantly placing the tongue between the posterior teeth will lead to space between the maxillary and mandibular molars and premolars or just some of them. If you see this kind of space. Be aware of the habits of the patient! Sometimes these habits are related to TMD problems and sometimes it is related to… well a bad habit. If it is a TMD-related problem. It may be a good idea to create an oral appliance that can be used to diagnose the problem and figure out what will help the patient before starting treatment with clear aligners. If you are not comfortable treating TMD patients. It may be a good idea to refer these patients to a specialist.",

It may be a good idea to refer these patients to a specialist.\n\nTongue habits can be altered through intervention by a speech therapist or, in certain cases, by bonding spikes to the oral surfaces of the front teeth. The choice of treatment method depends on the specific habit being addressed. For those unfamiliar with spikes, they are sharp, pointed attachments bonded to the oral surface of the anterior teeth. They create discomfort when 48 4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONtouched by the tongue, often prompting patients to instinctively adjust their tongue placement to avoid discomfort. However, it's crucial to obtain patient commitment before implementing this approach. Patients need to be informed about the procedure and its purpose beforehand. You can attach prefabricated metal spikes or create them using a direct composite technique with a silicone mould. Metal spikes can be purchased from most ortho depots. The silicone mould kits are available in different depots or can be purchased on Amazon. Health and medical conditions It's essential to be aware of any medications a patient is taking to assess potential contraindications and tailor treatment plans accordingly. Collaboration with other healthcare providers may be necessary to manage any medication-related concerns during orthodontic treatment There are a number of conditions that may affect orthodontic treatment. Some conditions should even be considered a contraindication for treatment in a general practice. Several types of drugs may pose contraindications for orthodontic treatment. These include: -B i s p h o s p h o n a t e s : U s e d t o t r e a t osteoporosis and other bone-related conditions. Bisphosphonates affect or prevent bone remodelling. There are other types of drugs that interfere with bone remodelling. In our opinion, no general practitioner should start treatment on a patient taking any kind of drugs that affect bone remodelling. -Immunosuppressants: Corticosteroids or certain chemotherapy drugs, may affect the body's ability to respond to orthodontic treatment or increase susceptibility to infections. We do not consider the following drugs to be absolute contraindications for treatment. However, it is worth being aware of the potential side effects. -Certain antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may cause side effects like bruxism or jaw clenching, which may impact orthodontic treatment outcomes. Patients clenching their teeth may cause intrusion of the posterior teeth as they clench on the aligner material. This may lead to posterior open bites. In addition, heavy bruxers can even deform the aligners and cause unwanted tooth movements and tracking issues. -Hormonal therapies, including oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, may influence bone density and affect tooth movement during orthodontic treatment. -Medications causing dry mouth, such as antihistamines or certain antidepressants, can lead to an increased risk of tooth decay or gum disease. These drugs are often considered a challenge in treatments with fixed appliances. However, with clear aligners, it is a lot easier to maintain good oral hygiene. In addition, it is easy to apply topical fluorides or the like in the aligners and thereby decreasing the risk of caries. 49 4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONSeveral health issues may be considered contraindications for orthodontic treatment. These include: -Periodontitis: Any kind of periodontitis that is not under 100% control should be considered an absolute contraindication. Orthodontic treatment can exacerbate existing periodontal issues, leading to further bone loss and tooth mobility. Starting orthodontic treatment in perio patients accelerates the periodontal breakdown considerably! -Active infection: Orthodontic treatment may need to be postponed until any active infections, such as oral abscesses, are resolved to prevent complications. -Severe skeletal discrepancies: Certain skeletal abnormalities, such as severe craniofacial syndromes or skeletal growth disorders, may require specialised treatment beyond traditional orthodontics. -Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders: Patients with significant TMJ dysfunction may experience worsened symptoms with orthodontic treatment, necessitating careful evaluation and potential modifications to treatment plans. -Uncontrolled systemic diseases: Health conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension may impact healing and increase the risk of complications during orthodontic treatment. -Neurological disease or mobility impairment: If the use of clear aligners is difficult due to restricted movements or mental compliance treatment can be complicated significantly. -Pregnancy: While orthodontic treatment is generally safe during pregnancy, it may be postponed until after childbirth to avoid unnecessary stress and discomfort for the patient. -A c t i v e o r t h o d o n t i c t r e a t m e n t elsewhere: Patients currently undergoing orthodontic treatment with another provider may not be suitable candidates for additional orthodontic interventions until their current treatment is completed or resolved. Dental history Trauma to the teeth or jaws can lead to an increased risk of external resorption of the teeth. If there is any kind of ankylosis between the bone and a tooth. Starting orthodontic treatment may start an irreversible external resorption. Prior to treatment, it is not necessarily possible to identify an area of ankylosis on x-rays. Not even a CBCT. A sound test can be relatively reliable. However, if there is a past history of trauma to some front teeth. It may increase the risk of internal and external resorptions. The same applies to teeth transplanted during childhood. Patient expectations. There is no reason to start the clinical examination until you have made sure, that the patient’s expectation for the treatment result is realistic. Has the patient had any orthodontic treatment in the past? If that is the case it is nice to know if the patient has noticed any kind of relapse, and what kind of 50 4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONretention has been used. Has the patient had surgery in combination with ortho? Are there any social behavioural factors that could affect our treatment? -Patient compliance: The patient has to accept that the aligners have to be worn 22 hours/day prior to starting treatment. Is there any indication in the patient history or during the conversation with the patient, that may indicate problems with compliance, this has to be noted. -Unrealistic expectations? It is really important that we have outlined the expectations for the treatment before we start treating the patient! -Fear of treatment. Are there any psychological factors, that might interfere with a smooth treatment programme? -Financial concerns. We include the financial concerns of the patient here. Not because finances necessarily have a direct influence on treatment. However, we have observed several instances where dental practices have entered into instalment plans with patients before starting clear aligner treatment. In some cases, patients defaulted on their payments during treatment, leading the practice to discontinue care until payments resumed. This is a very unfortunate way of treating patients, as they risk ending up in a health situation that is worse than the one they started having before the treatment started. In order to prevent these situations we recommend you consider how to handle the financial aspects of orthodontic treatments in your practice.

This evaluation entails examining both the frontal and profile views of the patient.\n\nIt's crucial to conduct this assessment not only during the patient's visit but also when reviewing photos later in the treatment planning process. To ensure accuracy, the patient's head should be positioned naturally during record-taking and photography sessions. Profile view Jesper was once sitting in a casual setting with a colleague from Switzerland. During the conversation, clear aligner treatments were brought up. The colleague wondered out loud why the aligner companies wanted all the photos on the doctor portal. Intrigued by the comment, Jesper asked the colleague if he never looked at the extraoral and intraoral photos during his treatment planning process. The doctor honestly admitted, that he never looked at the photos. To him, they were considered an annoying and time consuming task, that had to be done with the only purpose of satisfying the clear aligner company. AP-Relationships In orthodontics, the AP-relationship, or the anterior-posterior relationship, refers to the alignment of the upper and lower jaws in relation to each other. It's a crucial aspect of assessing the overall occlusion and bite of a patient. 51",

The AP-relationship is evaluated by examining the position of the upper and lower teeth in relation to each other along the anterior-posterior axis as depicted in the image (Fig 4-1). A balanced AP-relationship ensures proper function and aesthetics of the bite. Begin the examination by assessing the anterior-posterior relationships. When examining the profile photo, the dentist assesses the position of the upper and lower lips in relation to each other and to a vertical reference line drawn from the bridge of the nose. Ideally, the upper lip should lie slightly in front of this line, while the lower lip may be slightly behind it, indicating a balanced AP-relationship (Fig 4-1). This alignment suggests proper positioning of the upper and lower jaws, contributing to an aesthetically pleasing facial profile. Deviations from the ideal AP-relationship can be observed in the profile photo. For instance, if the upper lip is significantly behind the reference line or the lower lip protrudes far in front of it, it may indicate an overbite or underbite, respectively. These discrepancies can affect both the aesthetics and function of the bite and may require orthodontic intervention to correct. Based on the vertical line of reference. In a normal skeletal class I relation, the upper jaw should be approximately 2 to 4 mm in front of the lower jaw.  In a Class II relationship, the lower jaw is observed to be situated more than 2 mm behind the upper jaw (Fig 4-2).  In a Class III relationship, the lower jaw is found to be less than 2 mm behind or even positioned in front of the reference line (Fig 4-3).   Another approach to assessing the AP relationship is as follows: •A predominantly straight profile often corresponds to a Class I molar relationship. •A convex profile, characterised by a retrognathic chin and a more protruded upper lip, typically indicates a Class II relationship. •Conversely, a concave profile featuring a protruded chin usually suggests a Class III molar relationship. Even with these basic guidelines. You will sometimes find situations with a profile and a   52\nFig 4-1 Class I straight\nFig 4-2 Class II convex\nFig 4-3 Class III concave",

Orthodontic treatment aims to correct any imbalances in the AP-relationship to achieve a harmonious occlusion and facial aesthetics. By evaluating the AP-relationship from a profile photo, you gain valuable insight into the alignment of the jaws and anticipate potential orthodontic issues, guiding further diagnosis and treatment planning for the patient. Mandibular plane angle (MPA) The mandibular plane angle provides valuable insights into the vertical relationships of the jaws and guides the delivery of comprehensive orthodontic care. The mandibular plane angle often provides an indication of a deep bite or open bite skeletal pattern. The mandibular plane angle is easily measured by drawing a line along the base of the mandible and relating it to the horizontal plane of the face (typically the line will follow the roof of the palate or the Frankfort horizontal plane, which is a reference plane established by a line connecting the lower border of the eye socket (orbitale) to the upper border of the external auditory meatus (porion)). An average mandibular plane angle will have the line pointing to the base of the skull around the occipital region (Fig 4-4). The MPA provides valuable information about the vertical position and growth pattern of the mandible relative to the cranial base. The MPA is analysed to assess: Vertical facial proportions: An increased MPA indicates a hyperdivergent growth pattern, characterised by a more vertically inclined mandible relative to the cranial base (Fig 4-5). Conversely, a reduced MPA suggests a hypodivergent growth pattern, with a more horizontally oriented mandible (Fig 4-6). Treatment planning: The MPA influences treatment decisions, particularly in cases requiring orthognathic surgery or vertical control of tooth movements. The patient's MPA should be considered when planning orthodontic mechanics and determining the appropriate treatment objectives to achieve 53 Fig 4-5 Increased Fig 4-4 Average Fig 4-6 Reduced 4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONoptimal facial aesthetics and functional outcomes. A reduced angle may indicate an increased muscular force of the m. masseter and m. temporalis. If the treatment plan indicates a need for an increased vertical dimension by extruding the molars, this kind of orthodontic movement may be compromised by the muscular forces. An increased angle may increase the likelihood of an anterior rotation of the mandible during an orthodontic treatment. This is important as the mandible in these instances will move forward and upwards whereby a horizontal overjet and open bite may decrease. If there is no real overjet an anterior rotation of the mandible may create complications in the relationship of the anterior teeth that may even result in an Angle class III relationship. Stability of treatment outcomes: Changes in the MPA may affect the stability of orthodontic treatment outcomes, particularly in cases involving surgical correction of skeletal discrepancies. Understanding the patient’s MPA helps anticipate post-treatment changes and implement appropriate strategies to maintain long-term stability. Vertical relations Vertical relations in orthodontics refer to the relationship between the upper and lower jaws and the rest of the facial structures, including the chin, lips, and profile. These relations are crucial considerations for orthodontists for several reasons: On the profile photo, the face is divided into thirds. 1/3 should be from the chin to the base of the nose. The middle third is from the base of the nose to a point between the eyebrows. The upper third is from the point between the eyebrows and up to the hairline, roughly. The vertical relations significantly influence the overall facial aesthetics and profile. A disharmony in the proportions of the facial thirds gives an indication of a facial disharmony. Of particular relevance is the increase or decrease of the lower face height. The lower face height is also divided into thirds. 1/3 should be from the base of the nose down to the mouth opening including the upper lip, 2/3 should be from the mouth opening including the lower lip and down to the chin (Fig 4-7). Proper alignment helps achieve a balanced facial appearance and an attractive smile. As a general dentist, it is of course unrealistic to change anything but the lower third of the face. However, being aware of all parts of the face is 54 Fig 4-7 Vertical relation in profile 4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATION crucial during treatment planning as you will be able to improve balance in the aesthetics. Functional Harmony is another important aspect of the analysis of the vertical relations. The vertical relations impact the function of the jaws, including speech articulation, swallowing, and facial muscle balance. In addition, the airways and breathing can be influenced by the vertical relationships as well. Any orthodontic treatment should aim towards correcting any discrepancies to optimise functional efficiency and comfort for the patient. Later when you start to look at the intraoral conditions and consider how to treat these conditions. It is crucial to always think about the impact the intraoral treatment will have on the extraoral vertical relations. Nasolabial angle In the profile photo, the nasolabial angle can be seen as the angle between the upper lip and the base of the nose (Fig 4-8). This angle indicates whether it is acceptable to move the maxillary teeth in an anterior or posterior direction. A normal nasolabial angle lies between 90 and 110°. A nasolabial angle above 110° indicates that it may be favourable to procline the maxillary front teeth. Increasing the lip support. E-line The E-line, also known as the aesthetic line, is a reference line used in orthodontics to assess facial aesthetics and the relationship between the lips, nose, and chin. It is a tool used to evaluate the harmony and balance of the facial profile during treatment planning. The E-line (Fig 4-9) is drawn from the tip of the nose (subnasale) to the tip of the chin (soft tissue pogonion). It serves as a standardised reference point for evaluating the position of the lips and chin relative to the rest of the face. This line can also aid in determining the profile of the patient. The E-line is used to assess the position of the lips in relation to the facial profile.

There is, however, a potential variation between males and females as well as between human races.\n\nJust think about how much of a difference the volume of the lips can change the interpretation of the E-line. Injectable fillers With an increasing number of patients getting fillers injected into their lips, this can have an effect on the facial analysis. Injectable lip fillers, typically composed of hyaluronic acid or other biocompatible substances, are used to enhance lip volume, shape, and contour. While these fillers are primarily used for cosmetic purposes, they can have implications for orthodontic treatment and long-term stability. Adding fillers to the lips may change the volume and the dynamics of the lips, which will change the forces defining the position of the anterior teeth without using retention. (Remember how the teeth will always be positioned in a perfect balance between the forces pushing the teeth in a buccal or lingual direction)  This can have an effect on the position of the anterior teeth and thereby also on the long-term stability of the final position of the incisors. Patients receiving injectable lip fillers should be informed about potential interactions with orthodontic treatment and the importance of regular monitoring. These patients should notify you of any planned changes in lip volume or position following filler injections, as these changes may necessitate adjustments to orthodontic treatment plans to maintain stability. In addition, you need to be aware that over time, injectable lip fillers may undergo natural degradation or absorption by the body, leading to changes in lip volume and contour. These soft tissue changes could affect the stability of treatment outcomes, particularly if they result in altered lip support or facial aesthetics. Relapse or shifting of the teeth may occur as a result of changes in soft tissue dynamics associated with filler degradation. Just as injectable fillers have a direct effect on the position and stability of the maxillary anterior teeth. The maxillary anteriors also have a direct influence on the volume of the upper lip. As the anterior teeth protrude, they exert pressure on the upper lip, leading to an increase in lip volume. Conversation about extraoral photos:  The Swiss doctor having a conversation with Jesper was both surprised and amazed by the impact teeth could have on soft tissue and vice versa. After a short period of reflection, the doctor admitted, that thinking back on some of the patients he had treated, there were several, that had experienced quite significant changes to their profile. One of his patients had ended up in a end to end position that had taken him a while to fix as he needed to use elastics and intrusion to correct the poster open bite and at the same time he wondered why the mandible had moved so much forward. Thinking back he thought it might be due to the increased AP relationship. Another patient of his expressed disappointment with the outcome of a clear aligner treatment, noting that her smile had diminished considerably. 56\n4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONReflecting on the treatment process, the doctor recalled the extensive use of interproximal reduction (IPR) alongside sequential distalisation of the maxillary teeth to address a horizontal overjet. Not only did the aesthetic results fall short of expectations, but considerable time was also dedicated to achieving a stable occlusion to alleviate the patient's headaches, without the need for a bite appliance. He admitted that had he known about the E-line and the nasio-labial angle he might have treated the patient differently. Frontal view. Reference lines Full-face photos are ideal for evaluating the frontal view of the patient. The photos should be taken with the patient holding the head in a natural posture. The interpupillary line: This is a straight line passing through the centre of the eyes representing a horizontal plane. Ideally, the interpupillary line is parallel to the horizontal plane. However, that is not always the case. The interpupillary line is the most suitable line of reference when carrying out a frontal facial analysis. Comparing the interpupillary line with the commissural plane (A straight line running between the upper and lower lip, and possibly the ophriac (eyebrows) line and the interalar plane (nose)) is often an ideal reference for the orientation of the incisal plane, the occlusal plane and the gingival levels. During the analysis of the frontal view, the face is divided into the same thirds as done in the profile view (Fig 4-10). Horisontal harmony in relation to vertical harmony To evaluate the horizontal harmony of the face. The interpupillary line is set in relation to the commissural line (Fig 4-11). To avoid facial disharmony, a parallel relationship should be established between the interpupillary line and the incisal/occlusal plane. Meaning that the interpupillary line and the incisal/occlusal plane should be parallel (Fig 4-11). Vertical harmony in relation to the facial midline The facial midline is traced by drawing a line straight through the middle of the face.

Preferably this line is perpendicular to the interpupillary line. The more centred and perpendicular the midline and the horizontal lines are, the greater the overall sense of harmony of the face (Fig 4-12). Transverse symmetry  This is often described as a harmony between five equally wide vertical areas of the face. Dividing the face into fifths, using the width of the eye as a reference width, will most often define the size of each vertical area (Fig 4-13).   The vertical lines are sometimes used as a reference for the ideal position of the canines in the maxilla. However as no face is actually symmetric, no general guidelines should be followed regarding the actual positioning of the teeth. Any significant asymmetry should be noted in the medical records as should the level of asymmetry.  Once a complete overview of the asymmetry in relation to the proportion of the face is established, striving for aesthetic harmony in balance with the functional/dynamic occlusion becomes much easier. Even in patients with very asymmetric faces.  Dentolabial analysis A Swedish dentist approached us, seeking confirmation on the realism of a virtual treatment plan she had been developing. She expressed satisfaction with both the plan and the anticipated end result. However, given the complexity of the case, she wanted expert validation. Notably, the Swedish dentist was keen on avoiding interproximal reduction (IPR) and moving the molars. We looked at the clinical photos. The patient was a classic class II patient with moderate crowding in the maxillary arch and mild crowding in the mandibular arch. In addition, the patient had a narrow smile with black corridors.   Comparing the clinical photos with the virtual treatment plan of the doctor. We discovered that in the virtual treatment plan, the maxillary anterior teeth would be protruded into a position that would align the teeth with a minimum of IPR. However, that would position the teeth on the dry zone of the lower lip creating a lip catch and thereby an unstable long term tooth position.  The mandibular anteriors had been translated and tipped buccally to resolve the crowding without IPR. This could potentially reduce the challenge with the maxillary anteriors. However the doctor had not taken into consideration, that the mandibular teeth would be moved out of the bone, creating gingival recessions - probably all the way to the apex due to the thin biotype and the existing initial recessions.    58\nFig 4-13 Transverse symmetry",

      "text": "4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONPurpose The primary purpose of the dentolabial analysis is to evaluate how the position, shape, and size of the teeth influence the appearance of the lips and overall facial harmony. With this information, the ideal position of the teeth in the face of the patient can be defined, in relation to the actual tooth position within the frame of the lips and the smile. The lips The shape of the lips can be classified as thin, medium or thick.  The height of the upper lip should, as a general rule, be half the height of the lower lip. Please take into consideration that a lot of varieties exist and that we always strive for harmony rather than perfect symmetry.  Sometimes however certain types of lips are associated with certain psychological traits.  Generally thick lips are associated with extroversion. While thin lips are associated with introversion. This can be important as we have the ability to affect the sizes of the lips to some extent depending on how the anterior teeth are being positioned during an orthodontic treatment.  Moving the anterior teeth in an anterior direction will potentially lead to an increased lip volume as the teeth push the lips forward, whereas the opposite can happen moving the anterior teeth in a posterior direction.   Tooth exposure at rest When the teeth are in maximum intercuspation, the lips should touch lightly and the incisal third of the maxillary incisors should be covered by the wet surface of the lower lip.  Competent lip closure is characterised by the upper and lower lips being able to meet comfortably without causing strain to the muscles surrounding the mouth (Fig 3-14). A potential competent lip closure is characterised by lips touching each other, but with teeth sticking out between the lips. This way the teeth prevent a complete closure of the lips without the use of muscle tension.  The lip closure is potentially competent due to physical obstructions. The lower lip is resting behind the upper front teeth.  Incompetent lip closure is characterised by a vertical dimension of the soft tissue not being big enough to cover the teeth. These patients are unable to close their lips without using muscle forces (Fig 3-14 the photo in the middle). Smile line The smile line or the smile arc gives an indication of where the maxillary front teeth should be positioned. The incisal plane, when observed from the front, should follow the natural curvature of the lower lip when smiling.  In addition, the teeth should stay within the wet zone of the lower lip (Fig 4-15). \n  59\nFig 3-14 competent lip closure            Incompetent lip closure     Potentially competent lip closure\n4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATION\nYou can use a “tip down smile” photo to verify the position of the maxillary teeth in relation to the wet and dry zone of the lower lip (Fig 4-16). Lip Line In orthodontics, the term \"lip line\" typically refers to the amount of maxillary incisor display when the lips are relaxed or in a repose position. It's assessed in smile analysis and treatment planning to achieve balanced and harmonious aesthetics. While the range of 3 to 5 mm is commonly cited as ideal, it may be adjusted depending on the treatment goals, based on the patient's unique facial features and preferences.s (Fig 4-17). There can be variations in what is considered \"normal\" depending on factors such as facial morphology, lip competence, and individual aesthetic preferences. Additionally, the amount of incisor display may vary among individuals and can be influenced by factors such as lip thickness, tooth size, and smile arc. When smiling, optimal dental aesthetics dictate that the inferior border of the upper lip should harmoniously align with the gingival margin of the maxillary incisors (Fig 4-18). In cases of exuberant smiling, some patients may exhibit an excessive display of gingival tissue, a phenomenon often referred to as a \"gummy smile” (Fig. 4-19).  This condition can stem from various etiological factors, including a deficient upper lip length, diminished labial mobility, or an exaggerated vertical growth pattern of the maxilla. Observationally, younger individuals tend to manifest a greater extent of maxillary tooth display during smiling, with females typically showcasing more anterior dental prominence than their male counterparts. This tendency is purportedly linked to the perception of youthfulness associated with a fuller exhibition of the maxillary anterior dentition. Conversely, as individuals age, there is a natural regression in the visibility of the maxillary anterior teeth during smiling, reflecting the inherent developmental changes. Such age-related alterations are concurrent with the overall gravitational descent of facial structures over time.   60\nFig 4-15 Smile line\nFig 4-16 Tip down smile",

ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONHow the class II case was resolved: To resolve the problem we saw in the virtual treatment plan of the Swedish doctor, we observed that there was room for more posterior expansion. This would reduce the black corridors, improve the arch form and create space. Combining the expansion with rotating the molars and premolars into a more ideal position would create a lot of space for a retraction of the anterior teeth. Combined with 0,4 mm. of IPR from second premolar to second premolar we would be able to prevent a sequential distalisation. This would avoid the challenges of an extrusion effect on the anterior maxillary teeth due to class II elastics. In addition, the shape of the anterior teeth would benefit from more IPR due to their triangular shape and thereby reducing the risk of black triangles. Realising this the Swedish doctor was convinced that IPR would actually be a better solution than no IPR. Dental midline vs. facial midline When smiling, the facial midline, should be coherent with the dental midline. The dental midline is also sometimes referred to as the interincisal line.  It is important that the dental midline and the facial midlines are parallel, ideally, they are overlapping (Fig 4-22)(Fig 4-11). A dental midline deviation from the facial midline is not necessarily observed by the patient. As a rule of thumb, a midline deviation needs to be bigger than 4 millimetres to be registered by patients with a non-dental background.  Dentists typically register a midline deviation bigger than 2 millimetres. While orthodontists register midline deviations bigger than 1 millimetre.  Considering this perspective, it is advisable not always to inform patients about a midline deviation, unless the patient points out the deviation him- or herself. Sometimes it is really difficult to position the dental midline ideally perpendicular to the facial midline. In adult patients, there are not always as many options to move the teeth as in kids without surgery. Since patients being informed about a midline deviation, often want it fixed 100% and tend to focus on it during and after treatment. This can create a need for challenging compromises in other areas of the mouth that might not have been needed if the patient (and the doctor) would be willing to accept a minor deviation of the midline.  Sometimes, a discrepancy in the dental midline of the maxillary and mandibular arches can be observed. When smiling, the upper midline is usually the most visible and therefore the most important. Ideally, the maxillary and mandibular midlines should align, but this is not always the case. We believe that achieving optimal static and functional occlusion is more important than perfect midline alignment. Consequently, we will accept a midline deviation if it allows for a better static and functional occlusion.  It's imperative for the maxillary midline to align precisely with the facial midline. Even a subtle deviation, known as a midline cant, where the dental midline tilts compared to the facial midline, can be noticeable to anyone.

Preferably the lip line of the upper lip is also parallel to the interpupillary line (Fig 4-23)(Fig 4-11). The lip line may be affected by the position of the teeth as the upper lip is supported by the teeth. But it will not always be the case. An additive wax-up transferred to the teeth can help clarify this.  (For more information about this technique. Please research DSD or Digital Smile Design and the associated motivational mockup).  In addition to the lip line, the levels of the gingival zenith and the levels of the papillae should also be parallel to the interpupillary line.  Patients with facial asymmetries often require a more customised approach than simply adhering to standard guidelines. Some may present with an interpupillary line that deviates significantly from the horizontal, while others may have different, distinct asymmetries. Each case is unique and demands a comprehensive diagnostic and treatment planning process. In such cases, accurately diagnosing the cause of the asymmetry is crucial, as it can be influenced and potentially altered by orthodontic treatment. Utilizing tools like Digital Smile Design, articulators, and wax-ups can greatly aid in planning and executing a treatment strategy tailored to the individual patient’s needs. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) An examination of the temporomandibular joint is important prior to any orthodontic treatment. Changing the bite potentially affects the temporomandibular joints and the muscles. The human body is able to adapt to a lot. Especially children will adapt well to changes in the occlusion, even if the occlusion is not in an optimum balance with the joints and muscles.

It's not necessarily about how the aligner treatment will affect these conditions but rather to inform the patient about their current state. As patients embark on their aligner treatment journey, they tend to become more attuned to their teeth, joints, and muscles. Diagnosing and documenting any pre-existing issues helps you inform the patients about their conditions and go through the potential risks related to these when starting a clear aligner treatment.  In addition to informing the patient about these findings and the potential consequences, it improves your ability to design a treatment plan that takes the diagnostic findings into account.  Centric relation and occlusion philosophy. Regarding occlusion, there are typically two different philosophies that you should be familiar with, as the treatment plan can vary significantly depending on which philosophy is used during treatment: 1.Philosophy no. 1 The joints and muscles will adapt to minor misalignments. This means that if the teeth fit together well when holding models of the maxilla and the mandible together in free hand, The body will adapt to any discrepancy between the teeth, joints and muscles.  This philosophy is also sceptical about a possible link between temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD), occlusion and dynamic function of the teeth.  2.Philosophy no. 2 The joints are ideally positioned in centric relation (CR), which serves as the most reliable reference point. The occlusion is organised in a way, that enables ideal dynamic function of the muscles, joints, soft tissue and teeth. In this position, the muscles will relax, providing a stable foundation where the teeth fit together harmoniously and the risk of pain, dental wear and traumatic occlusion will be minimal.  We are convinced that both philosophies have their merits, but that applying the first philosophy to adult patients can be very difficult and risky. Mainly because we know too little about the connection between function, joints, muscles, teeth and the neurological processes involved to be able to select those patients where it is not necessary to take into account a possible connection.  We are in favour of maximum predictability and therefore take an approach where we use CR and treatment philosophies based on functional occlusion as our reference when carrying out our treatment planning. By applying this second philosophy, we recognise that we may risk over-treating some individuals. However, we believe this outweighs the risk of mistreating patients who do not tolerate the changes we can achieve with orthodontic treatment - with no consideration for muscles, joints and function.  This book isn't focused on functional occlusion but is instead designed to be a practical guide for general practitioners interested in utilising clear aligners. Consequently, we will only briefly address the topic and provide some useful tips for those practitioners who wish to incorporate centric relation (CR) principles alongside clear aligner treatments.   64",

ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONfixed appliances or any other orthodontic appliance in this regard. This means that clear aligner treatments with more complex challenges (like a discrepancy between MIP and CR) often require revisions (additional aligners) as it is impossible to anticipate everything that can or will happen during treatment.  With a big difference between MIP and CR, it is often advisable to consider whether the patient is in fact a surgical case that should be referred to an orthodontist.  The deprogrammer effect Any orthodontic intervention, including clear aligner treatments, can induce effects akin to a deprogrammer. As a natural consequence of teeth undergoing orthodontic movement, soreness may occur, triggering a neurofeedback loop that potentially reduces muscle activity. This decreased muscle activity can cause the mandible to relax, facilitating the temporomandibular joint to seat into centric relation (CR) during treatment. Occasionally, this may result in an anterior open bite, seemingly deviating from the treatment plan. (While various factors can contribute to an anterior open bite, this auto-rotation phenomenon is observed intermittently). Thorough pre-treatment diagnostics significantly mitigate the likelihood of inadvertent CR seating without the attending practitioner's awareness of the associated risks. Identifying this risk promptly empowers you to evaluate whether continuing with the treatment aligns with your comfort level or if referring the patient elsewhere for treatment is preferable. The opposite of the muscles relaxing due to clear aligner treatment is of course also possible. When this happens patients can present with headaches or suddenly show signs of a posterior open bite. The posterior open bites in these cases develop as the aligners take up more space than the teeth usually do. Since the vertical dimension stays the same over time, the patient bites hard on the posterior aligner material resulting in the intrusion of the most posterior teeth. Be aware that this is relatively rare. There are other factors, that more often lead to posterior open bites, than the intrusion of the posterior teeth.  Without any evidence to back this up. We tend to see this kind of open bite more often in patients with a reduced mandibular plane angle. These patients are most often able to bite considerably harder than patients with normal or increased mandibular plane angles.  Intraoral examination When treating a patient with clear aligners, it is important to maintain a good oral hygiene before, during and after the treatment. No plaque or untreated caries should be found. All teeth and restorations should be examined thoroughly. Making sure that the quality of the restorations is sufficient and will last during an orthodontic treatment.  As described previously. Any trauma history is important. The movement of teeth with damaged root surfaces or root fractures may damage the teeth unnecessarily during any orthodontic treatment. This emphasises the importance of considering previous trauma when planning and executing clear aligner treatments.

Therefore no clear aligner treatment should be started on patients with any kind of active periodontal disease.  The biotype of the soft tissue should be evaluated. A thin biotype indicates limited amounts of bone, increasing the risk of gingival recessions during or after treatment. Any erosions or attritions should be documented in the medical records and in the clinical photos. This is advised because certain patients may observe these changes during treatment and incorrectly attribute them to the clear aligners. In addition, there exists a theory (controversial to some) that attrition/abfractions might be related to a dysfunctional occlusion/function (Bruxism or occlusal wear).  Documenting these changes prior to a clear aligner treatment will eliminate any doubt about the relation to the orthodontic treatment.  Spacing and crowding The teeth are always positioned in a perfect balance between the muscular forces of the tongue and the cheeks and lips. Spacing (Fig 4-25) or Crowding (Fig 4-26) have to be registered.  It is important to examine how big this deviation from an ideal tooth position is, as it can have a big impact on the treatment plan.   Spacing In cases with spacing, it is fairly easy to measure how much excess space there is between the teeth. These measurements define how severe the condition is and whether the patient is a good candidate for clear aligner treatment or not.  Retracting and closing all spaces is rather easy orthodontically. However, it may restrict the airways and the space for the tongue and will most often be really difficult to retain, no matter the type of retainer. We have seen cases where a bonded retainer kept deboning due to the pressure of the tongue. In other cases a bonded retainer from the first premolar to the first premolar resulted in the tongue pushing the entire anterior segment in an anterior direction, leaving a bilateral diastema distal to the first premolars.   With the growing emphasis on airway and breathing considerations in dentistry, it is advisable not to impede the tongue's space.

In addition, there is the Bolton analysis.  This tool helps define the relationship between the upper and the lower arch. The Bolton analysis shows how much tooth substance there is in the upper arch compared to the lower arch.

During treatment, most orthodontists strive for a flat curve of Spee. This is reflected in the way most orthodontic brackets are designed. When positioned according to the manufacturer's guidelines, the orthodontic brackets will have a flat curve of Spee built into their design.  The reason for the flat design, of the curve of Spee, seems to be linked to the expectation that a certain amount of relapse will occur after treatment. By initially overcorrecting slightly and creating a flat curve of Spee, possibly in combination with a small amount of open bite (no anterior coupling), space is created for the teeth to settle into a harmonious and long-term stable position. This also indicates the importance of incorporating the long-term dynamics of the occlusion into the overall treatment plan from the start of orthodontic treatment. Functional Occlusion:  In the context of functional occlusion, there may be variations in opinions regarding the ideal curve of Spee depending on the specific philosophy or approach being followed. Some functional occlusion theories, such as those influenced by the teachings of Dr. Peter Dawson or Dr. Panadent, emphasise the importance of achieving a balanced o c c l u s i o n a n d h a r m o n y b e t w e e n t h e temporomandibular joints, muscles, and teeth. In these approaches, the curve of Spee may be adjusted as part of comprehensive treatment planning to optimise occlusal function and minimise the risk of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). In this regard, it's not always beneficial to have a completely flat curve of Spee. As a flat curve of Spee makes it more difficult to achieve immediate posterior disclusion.  It is worth mentioning that these philosophies typically strive for hard occlusal contacts on the posterior teeth and light contact on all anterior teeth. This can create challenges if the curve of Spee increases and relapse occurs over time. As this can potentially lead to a posterior open bite.  Neither the orthodontic philosophies nor the philosophies about functional occlusion seem to be supported by evidence-based studies.  Biomechanic Considerations:  From a biomechanic standpoint, the ideal curve of Spee may also be influenced by factors such as the patient's skeletal and dental morphology, the presence of malocclusions or skeletal discrepancies, and the treatment objectives. Orthodontic treatment planning may involve assessing the relationship between the curve of Spee and other occlusal parameters, such as overbite, overjet, and molar relationships, to achieve optimal functional and aesthetic outcomes. Individual Variation:  It's important to recognise, that there can be significant variation in the curve of Spee among individuals. Factors such as age, gender, dental arch form, and occlusal wear patterns can all influence the shape and magnitude of the curve. Therefore, the ideal curve of Spee may not be a one-size-fits-all concept and may need to be customised based on the specific needs and characteristics of each patient. Overall, while there may be different opinions and approaches regarding the ideal curve of Spee in orthodontics and functional occlusion, the primary goal is to achieve a stable, harmonious occlusion that promotes optimal oral health and function for each individual patient. Treatment planning should involve careful assessment and consideration of   71\n4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONvarious factors to determine the most appropriate approach for achieving these goals. Angle classification/molar and canine relation The angle classification is used to define the relationship between the molars in the upper and the lower arch, as well as the canine relation between the upper and lower arch. Class I A class I molar and canine relation is also called a normal or natural relation. In a class I relation the mesio-buccal cusp of the upper first molar bites the buccal groove of the lower first molar in MIP . For the canine relation, the maxillary canine bites down between the mandibular canine and the first premolar (Fig 4-31). Class II  In a class II malocclusion, the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar bites in front of the buccal groove of the first mandibular molar. This is also called a distal occlusion because the mandible is in a more distal position compared to the natural/normal relation.   The class II deviation can be classified as either a skeletal or a dental deviation. In addition, the class II deviation is also divided into two divisions, depending on the relation of the maxillary and mandibular incisors.   Class II div. 1 (Fig 4-32):  The anterior maxillary teeth create an overjet. The anterior teeth, including the canines, are positioned more anteriorly compared to the lower front teeth. Often a deep bite relationship will be present, as the anterior mandibular teeth do not have any occlusal stop which leads the teeth to over erupt. The class II div. 1 is also called a dysplastic overbite.  Class II div. 2 (Fig 3-33):  The maxillary front teeth are retroclined, compensating for a big overjet.  Typically the maxillary upper centrals are retroclined while the upper laterals are sticking out.  Patients with Class II division 2 malocclusion frequently present with a deep overbite. This is because the maxillary anterior teeth appear to be extruded when retroclined or lingually inclined. Such retroclination of the anterior teeth alters their relationship with the mandibular arch, \n  72\nFig 4-31 Class I\nFig 4-32 CL II div. 1",

During orthodontic treatment, when the teeth involved in the crossbite are being repositioned, discomfort may occur, particularly when the aligners are not worn. This discomfort arises because the first point of contact shifts from the lingual to the labial surface of the mandibular teeth as the crossover occurs. During this transitional phase, the teeth involved in the transition will hit as the first point of contact (Fig 4-35). If a deep crossbite exists between the teeth, it may become necessary to elevate the bite during orthodontic treatment to facilitate the transition of the teeth. One method to achieve this is by incorporating bite ramps onto the palatal surface of the maxillary incisors. These bite ramps are meticulously integrated into the digital treatment plan and subsequently embedded into the aligners, eliminating the need to bond composite bite ramps onto the tooth surfaces. An alternative approach to temporarily raising the bite involves placing bite ramps on the occlusal surface of the posterior teeth. However, not all aligner systems support this method, and it can pose challenges due to greater forces exerted in the posterior region of the mouth.

ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONdetermining the final mandibular position without interferences. As mentioned earlier, aligner software doesn't precisely position the upper and lower jaws in an articulator, posing challenges in planning the exact final position of teeth in both jaws. Thus, it's essential to have a comprehensive overview and plan before commencing orthodontic treatment. While adjustments to the treatment plan may be necessary during treatment since the aligner software cannot fully simulate the exact final occlusal position, having a clear vision of the treatment's end result from the outset aids in understanding a complex treatment plan and breaking it down into manageable stages. Similar to anterior crossbites, posterior crossbites can also be treated with clear aligners. While clear aligners alone can slightly elevate the bite, in cases of a deep crossbite, it may be beneficial to incorporate bite ramps, either in the anterior or posterior teeth. Additionally, informing the patient about potential discomfort during the transition period is crucial (Fig 4-36). Rotations Rotated teeth occupy more space within the dental arch compared to teeth that are not rotated. By strategically planning the de-rotation of these teeth, we can ensure they fit properly within the dental arch. This realignment process has the potential to reduce the necessity for interproximal reduction (IPR) (Fig 4-37). This is one reason we encourage always evaluating all possible tooth movements in any clear aligner treatment. Too often, we see doctors choosing to treat only the social 6 or 8 teeth in the maxilla in situations where excessive IPR is needed. This could have been prevented or significantly reduced if the molars had been rotated into their ideal position. Static occlusion A registration of the static occlusion has always been mandatory prior to any orthodontic treatment.  It is of course important to know exactly where the teeth of the maxilla and mandible fit together when the patient occludes in MIP . However, it is worth noting the potential difference between the habitual occlusion in MIP , and the occlusion in centric relation (CR).  Before initiating any clear aligner treatment, the primary step should always involve assessing and controlling the occlusion as set by the aligner company in the digital setup. This setup must be meticulously compared with the occlusion observed in the patient's photos. If discrepancies are noted between the digital setup and the actual bite seen in the photos, it's imperative for aligner technicians to adjust and reset the bite to align with the patient's occlusion. No treatment planning or modifications of the virtual treatment plan should be performed before the bite is set correctly. If treatment planning is initiated before the bite is set correctly, clinical treatment will result in an occlusion that doesn't fit the patient.    75\nFig 4-37 Posterior rotations",

ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONposition for the occlusion, establishing canine guidance to facilitate immediate disclusion of the posterior teeth, alongside even anterior guidance distributed evenly on both central incisors. During lateral movement of the mandible, a smooth transition from canine guidance to contact with the incisal edges is essential. To achieve optimal canine and anterior guidance, it's crucial to consider the patient's functional pattern and avoid creating a restricted envelope of function. In our initial digital setups, we often observe steep positioning of the maxillary and mandibular anteriors. This inclination may pose a risk of restricted function, potentially leading to increased wear or fractures of the anterior teeth. Hence, we take great care to address these concerns to ensure patients achieve a functional occlusion that promotes long-term oral health and stability (Fig 4-39). It's important to recognise that treatment philosophy may vary among practitioners. The emphasis here is on the need for clinicians to critically evaluate the virtual treatment plans provided by the clear aligner companies. As mentioned previously, the ultimate treatment outcome rests on the clinician's shoulders and not solely on the aligner company. This underscores the importance of clinicians actively engaging in the treatment planning process, carefully assessing and scrutinising virtual treatment plans to ensure they align with their treatment philosophy and objectives. By taking ownership of the treatment process, clinicians can effectively steer the course of treatment to achieve optimal outcomes for their patients. Advantages of integrating functional occlusion in clear aligner treatment planning If you're interested in delving deeper into the principles of functional occlusion and mastering the ability to manage complex cases with confidence and control, we highly recommend exploring the courses offered by the institutes mentioned earlier. Institutions such as The Pankey Institute, Dawson Academy, Spear Education, and Kois Center are renowned for their comprehensive and advanced training programs in occlusion and advanced dentistry. These courses provide invaluable insights, techniques, and strategies for understanding and implementing functional occlusion principles in clinical practice. They equip clinicians with the knowledge and skills necessary to diagnose, treatment plan, and execute complex cases effectively, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and satisfaction. By investing in continuing education through these esteemed institutes, clinicians can enhance their expertise, expand their clinical capabilities, and elevate the quality of care they provide to their patients. Absolutely, understanding the intricate interplay between the temporomandibular joints (TMJs), muscles, and teeth is paramount when planning orthodontic treatment for adult patients. This knowledge enables clinicians to develop comprehensive treatment plans tailored to each patient's unique occlusal and functional needs. By comprehensively assessing the relationship between the TMJs, muscles, and teeth, clinicians can identify potential issues such as malocclusions, temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), and occlusal instability. This allows for 77 4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONthe formulation of treatment strategies that not only address the aesthetic concerns but also promote long-term oral health and stability. Moreover, considering the functional aspects of treatment ensures that the occlusion functions harmoniously, minimising the risk of relapse and enhancing treatment outcomes. Incorporating this comprehensive approach to treatment planning empowers clinicians to achieve optimal results while prioritising the overall health and well-being of their patients. Planning anterior relationships In general, there are two different approaches to the final anterior occlusion in the anterior segment. One is to create anterior coupling. The other is to leave a slight overjet. The decision to plan for one or the other depends on the philosophy of the doctor treating the patient. In cases where the mandibular incisors have been intruded more than 2 millimetres, it's important to anticipate some degree of relapse. Even when utilising a bonded retainer in combination with a nighttime aligner, there is a likelihood of relapse occurring. Intrusion of mandibular incisors beyond 2 millimetres can result in changes to the surrounding soft tissues, bone, and occlusal relationships. Despite the use of retention methods such as bonded retainers and nighttime aligners, the inherent biomechanical factors and physiological responses of the periodontal tissues may predispose the teeth to relapse over time. Clinicians should counsel patients about the potential for relapse and the importance of long-term retention protocols to minimise its occurrence. Regular monitoring and adjustments to retention strategies may be necessary to maintain the achieved results effectively. This can lead to a posterior open bite in cases where anterior coupling has been planned from the start. However it depends on the treatment, the muscular function of the patient and the chosen type of retention.

Radiographs Panoramic X-ray It is mandatory to have a panoramic radiograph (Fig 4-40) of the patient prior to starting treatment. This will give an overview of the conditions of all the teeth and the bone. External resorptions and apical pathology should be diagnosed and treated or evaluated prior to any orthodontic treatment. In addition to the panoramic X-ray we recommend taking a set of X-rays of the maxillary- and mandibular incisors as these are often blurred on a panoramic X-ray. Intraoral X-rays Additional single-tooth X-rays (Fig 4-41) may be indicated if there are signs of apical pathology on the panoramic X-ray. It is of paramount importance to ensure good documentation of the condition of the roots before starting a clear aligner treatment. Comprehensive diagnostics off the radiographs, prior to aligner treatment reduces the risk of starting a treatment that initiates a pathological process. In addition, it ensures documentation of the pre-treatment conditions, like external resorption of the roots. This is important as external resorptions are a well-documented risk related to orthodontic treatment. Although the risk is low in aligner therapy, there have been reports of external resorptions related to aligner treatments. 78 4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATION Cephalometric X-ray Cephalometric X-rays, allow us to analyse the conditions of the skeletal, the dental and some of the soft tissue relations (Fig 4-42). As dentists, we have an obligation to reduce the amount of radiation to a minimum. When treating adults with clear aligners, is it difficult to justify the need for a cephalometric X-ray for all kinds of treatments. Especially in cases with the need for minor movements of the teeth. It is important to be clear about what kind of information is required prior to exposing a patient to radiation. A good profile photo in combination with good intraoral buccal photos, showing the molar relationship of the patient, will often be able to give a rough visualisation of the skeletal, the dental and the soft tissue relationships. When a skeletal deviation is present, you will rarely be in doubt, when you know what to look for. In patients with a skeletal deviation, there is often an indication for surgery. However, it depends on the severity and on the individual. Some adult patients will not accept orthognathic surgery, even though they have a clear indication for the treatment. Others have conditions where surgery will increase a risk to the patient's health. In these instances, a treatment with clear aligners will most often be considered a compromise. Since the aligner treatment will only be able to move the teeth and not the jaws the skeletal deviation will not be corrected. If the patient does not have any symptoms from the joint, any problems with the bite, or any aesthetic issues or problems, we most often experience that the adult patient is not willing to go through surgery to correct the skeletal deviation. Before treating this kind of patient. It is worth considering the consequences if the patient shows up years after your clear aligner treatment, presenting a health issue related to the treatment compromise. Cephalometric analysis The cephalometric X-ray is a valuable tool for analysing the skeletal and dental relationships, utilising reference points on the skull (Fig 4-43). Various methods of cephalometric analysis exist, depending on the preferred school and methodology of the orthodontist. Typically, orthodontists have one or two preferred models they use most frequently. Below we have 79 Fig",

ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATION highlighted some of the most used lines of reference and the the standards within which we will normally try to bring a patient during orthodontic treatment. Among other aspects, cephalometric analysis provides insights into skeletal vertical relations, also known as facial height. Prior to cephalometric analysis, the vertical dimension of the patient's face is typically evaluated through clinical examination and analysis of clinical photos. During cephalometric analysis, anterior-posterior skeletal relations are assessed using reference points on the base of the skull in conjunction with those on the maxilla and mandible. One crucial aspect is the relationship between lines drawn from the root of the nose to the most prominent points of the maxilla and mandible, respectively. Ideally, the angle formed by these lines should be approximately 3° +/- 2°, representing the optimal position of the anterior-posterior relation between the maxilla and mandible. By examining the relationships between the maxilla and mandible as described above, it's often possible to determine whether the overjet is due to skeletal or dental factors. This insight aids in treatment planning and determining the appropriate course of action for correcting the overjet. The inclination of the maxillary incisors should ideally be 109° +/-6° in relation to the maxillary plane. The inclination of the mandibular incisors should be 93° +/-6° in relation to the mandibular plane. When the teeth are in their ideal position in the bone, the teeth should be within a normal overjet. A different way to measure the relationship between the maxillary and mandibular incisors is by comparing the lingual angle between the lines created by the long axis of the maxillary and the mandibular incisors. This gives an indication of the relationship between the teeth. Ideally, this angle should be approximately 135°.

ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONskeletal relation between the maxilla and the mandible. A cephalometric analysis is typically indicated for patients requiring orthognathic surgery and in children with orthodontic treatment needs. However, it's essential to emphasise that treating these patient populations requires specialised knowledge and expertise. We strongly advise against general practitioners undertaking orthodontic treatment in children or patients requiring surgical intervention. Treating children effectively involves a deep understanding of growth and development, as well as the ability to anticipate and manage orthodontic issues that may arise during this dynamic period. Similarly, managing surgical cases n e c e s s i t a t e s e x t e n s i v e k n o w l e d g e o f interdisciplinary coordination and treatment planning, particularly in collaboration with surgeons. This level of expertise is typically not within the scope of a general practice. Becoming an orthodontist requires rigorous training, typically spanning 3-4 years, precisely because of the complexity and depth of knowledge required to successfully treat these patient populations. Therefore, it's prudent for general practitioners to refer such cases to qualified orthodontists who possess the requisite skills and experience to provide optimal care. Malocclusions/diagnostics Prior to any dental treatment we need to be able to diagnose the patients correctly in order to plan and perform the ideal treatment. Accurate diagnosis is essential in orthodontics for effective treatment planning and execution. The primary focus of orthodontic diagnosis is malocclusions, which are misalignments of the teeth and jaws. Defining a normal occlusion serves as a reference point for identifying malocclusions.

      "text": "Larry Andrews conducted a notable study from 1960 to 1964, where he gathered information from general practitioners and orthodontists. They identified 120 individuals who had never undergone orthodontic treatment and exhibited a pleasing appearance with a comfortable bite. These individuals served as a model for what was considered a \"normal\" occlusion, providing a benchmark against which malocclusions could be assessed. By comparing patients occlusions to this established norm, orthodontists can diagnose malocclusions and determine the appropriate treatment approach. This underscores the importance of understanding what constitutes normal occlusion and using it as a reference point in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Dr. Larry Andrews six keys to normal occlusion It is worth noticing that both Dr. Larry Andrew and Dr. Angle made their conclusions based on findings on Caucasians. This means that their findings may not always be applicable to all human species. The first key - molar relationship. Previously we went through the Angle classifications (Fig 4-31 to Fig 4-34). Dr. Larry Andrew found the class I occlusion to be his first key to normal occlusion. The second key - mesio-distal angulation of the teeth. When examining the long axis of the teeth in relation to the midline of the patient’s face, it's observed that the long axis is not perfectly straight or parallel to the midline. Instead, there is a slight   81\n4. ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATION\ndistal deviation of the apex. Rather than recalling specific degrees of deviation, it's simpler to remember that the maxillary front teeth, from canine to canine, should angle downward toward the belly button along their long axes (Fig 4-44). The third key - the crown inclination. Crown inclination, both labio-lingual and bucco-lingual, plays a crucial role in preventing over-eruption of the incisors. When assessing the inclination of the crowns in both the upper and lower arches, it's important to note specific angles. The long axis of the maxillary incisors should be angled approximately 25° lingually to a vertical line defined by the 90° angle formed by the occlusal plane. Similarly, the mandibular incisors should be positioned at around 16° to this 90° vertical line. When examining a cephalometric analysis, the long axes of the maxillary and mandibular incisors should form an angle of approximately 135° on the lingual surface (Fig 4-45). If the inclination of the anterior teeth is too steep, there is an increase in developing a restricted envelope of function. Clinically this can result in increased wear of the incisors, loosening of the teeth, development of diastemas and destruction of anterior restorations. The fourth key - rotations. As mentioned earlier, rotated teeth take up more space in the dental arch. Rotated posterior teeth take up more space, whereas rotated anterior teeth affect aesthetics and interfere with the occlusion. A treatment plan taking the posterior rotations into consideration can result in a need for less IPR compared to a treatment only focusing on the anterior 8-10 teeth (Fig 4-46). The fifth key - inter-proximal contacts. The contacts between two teeth should not be too tight and there should not be any spacing. If there are no anomalies in the shape of the teeth and/or any Bolton discrepancy, there should be good contact and no space between the teeth (Fig 4-47). The sixth key - the occlusal plane. The curve of Spee should be flat, or not more than 1.5 mm from the deepest point in the posterior region to the highest point in the anterior region (Fig 4-30). Restorative dentists with a specific treatment philosophy may prefer a slightly steeper curve of   82\nFig 4-45 Crown inclination\nFig 4-44 Mesio-distal angulation",

ORTHODONTIC ASSESSMENT/EXAMINATIONChecklist: 1.Patient history: ★Collect patient name, date of birth, and medical history. ★Review dental history, including trauma or prior orthodontic treatments. ★Document patient desires and expectations for the outcome. ★Identify oral habits that may affect treatment. ★Gather necessary clinical photos, X-rays, and IO-scans. 2.Extraoral assessment: ★Assess facial profile. ★Measure vertical relations ★Evaluate the nasolabial angle and E-line for the upper lip position. ★Ensure proper alignment of the occlusal plane with interpupillary line. ★Palpate muscles and examine temporomandibular joints for any abnormalities. 1.Intraoral assessment: ★Check periodontal health to ensure no active disease. ★Document crowding or spacing, and perform Bolton analysis for tooth size discrepancies. ★Measure overjet and overbite. ★Evaluate the curve of Spee and Angle classification for molar and canine relations. ★Review dental midline alignment with facial midline. ★Identify any anterior or posterior crossbites and assess the severity. ★Record rotations and occlusion for treatment planning. Actionable Tips: 1.Patient screening and assessment: ★Begin with a thorough medical and dental history review, including the patient’s motivations for treatment. This helps establish realistic expectations and sets the stage for successful clear aligner therapy. 2.Oral habits and tongue function: ★Identify any oral habits (like nail-biting or pen-chewing) that may affect treatment. For patients with anterior or posterior open bites, be mindful of tongue positioning and consider habit-breaking interventions, such as spikes for severe cases. 3.Comprehensive diagnostic data: ★High-quality diagnostic data—such as clinical photos, IO-scans, and X-rays—are crucial for proper assessment. This data will help you assess facial aesthetics, tooth movements, and overall dental health, laying the groundwork for a successful treatment plan. 4.Evaluate AP and vertical relationships: ★The anterior-posterior (AP) relationships of the jaws and vertical facial relations are key to determining the appropriate treatment. These evaluations guide tooth movements and ensure alignment with the facial structures. 5.Bite and jaw position: ★Examine the occlusion and temporomandibular joints carefully, especially in complex cases.

BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTSBIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTS  Mismanagement of anchorage and class II elastics In an extremely complex case involving sequential distalisation of the maxilla and asymmetric intrusion of the maxillary incisors, Jesper overlooked the necessary anchorage and the reactive forces created by the Class II elastics he used. After treating the patient for over six months, he realised he had distalised and then mesialised the molars because he forgot to instruct the patient to use the Class II elastics. The situation worsened when he attempted to intrude the maxillary front teeth while the patient was using the Class II elastics, as they caused the teeth to move in the opposite direction as intended displacing the aligners. As a result, 12 months of treatment were wasted, with the teeth ultimately returning to their original positions.  This chapter is about biomechanics and tooth movements and how to predict the forces needed to move teeth into a desired position.  Biomechanics Definition Biomechanics is the study of the structure, function and motion of the mechanical aspects of biological systems, at any level from whole organisms to organs, cells and cell organelles, using the methods of mechanics. Force Force is a load applied to an object that both has a magnitude and a direction. Force can be represented/described as a vector when it has a magnitude and a direction. When dealing with clear aligners, it's essential to recognise that we are primarily working with pushing forces. Unlike fixed appliances, which can both push and pull, clear aligners mainly apply pushing forces.  When a force is applied to a tooth, it compresses the periodontal ligaments on one side, leading to bone resorption. Conversely, tension is created on the other side of the tooth, promoting bone deposition. However, if the pressure forces exceed the capillary blood pressure, cell death occurs. This results in bone resorption in the affected areas, causing pain and discomfort for the patient, and ultimately leading to slower tooth movements. Adding continuous light pressure to a tooth will result in a smooth, fast and less painful tooth movement (Fig 5-1). Clinical outcomes of employing weak forces: •Minutes later, blood flow changes •4 hours later, cell differentiation begins in the Periodontal Ligament (PDL) •2 days later tooth movement starts with bone re-modelling   88\n5. BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTS\nClinical consequences employing high forces: •Minutes later, the blood supply to the PDL is cut off Cell death is seen after a few hours •3-5 days later Cell division in adjacent cancellous bone •7-14 days later the Lamina dura adjacent to the compressed PDL is removed •14-25 days later tooth movement initiates. The manner in which forces are exerted on teeth determines the distribution of pressure within the tooth's alveolus. Forces are evenly dispersed in translation movements, where the entire tooth surface is uniformly shifted in one direction simultaneously, covering a larger bone area. Conversely, in tipping or intrusion movements, forces concentrate on a smaller bone area. This concentration leads to a localised high pressure zone within the bone, potentially causing cell death and impeding movement if the applied forces or pressure are excessive. This underscores the significance of employing gentle forces in dental treatments. To achieve this, a thorough analysis of all movements implicated in each phase of a clear aligner treatment is crucial. By scrutinising each step, adjustments can be made to the pace of treatment, tailored to the planned movements. This approach facilitates enhanced control over bone remodelling, resulting in more rapid and predictable tooth movements. The emphasis lies on employing light, continuous forces. The guiding principle appears to be: \"Slow down to speed up.” However just slowing down all kinds of movements in general, will in itself not necessarily result in a faster treatment. That is why it is imperative to meticulously analyse and fine-tune every step within the virtual treatment plan. Although this task might appear straightforward for AI to handle, it's more complex than it seems. This complexity arises from the multitude of factors at play beyond the movement of a single   89\nFig 5-1 Forces and periodontal reaction",

      "text": "5. BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTStooth. When a tooth is moved in a particular direction, an equal force is elicited in the opposite direction. This dynamic affects the overall treatment plan, as these forces intersect with those from all other planned tooth movements and the associated anchorage elements. How to distribute the forces can depend on the treatment philosophy of the doctor. Centre of resistance The centre of resistance holds significant importance as a fundamental reference point for precise tooth movement control in orthodontic treatment. Identifying the centre of resistance can substantially enhance treatment efficiency. This point is defined as the location where an applied force can induce bodily movement or translation of the affected tooth. The centre of resistance should not be considered a static point, but rather the unifying point of all the factors resisting the applied forces such as the tooth morphology, the size and morphology of the root as well as the number of roots, the mass distribution within the tooth, the shape of the periodontium, bone density, the bone level, the adjacent teeth and the direction of the applied force. It is difficult to predict the exact location of the centre of resistance. It differs from tooth to tooth, from patient to patient, and from situation to situation. However, it has a huge impact on the way any tooth movement has to be planned, in order to make the movement predictable. Moment When a force is applied to a tooth at a distance from its centre of resistance, it generates a rotational effect or moment. This moment is the product of the force and the distance from the centre of resistance, meaning the greater the distance, the greater the moment (Fig 5-2). Due to the centre of resistance. Applying a force to the crown of a tooth, will not initiate a bodily movement. Instead, the forces will be tipping or rotating the tooth around the centre of resistance. Depending on the desired kind of movement, all the different forces, centre of resistance and moment have to be taken into account. Couple In aligner therapy the aligner material is wrapped around the teeth, facilitating the application of forces at various points on the dental crown simultaneously. This capability allows for precise 90 Fig 5-2 Moment Fig 5-3 Couple 5. BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTScontrol of planned movements, a concept known as \"couple.\" Couple involve the application of two equal and opposite forces that produce a bodily movement (Fig 5-3). For example, to induce a bodily movement in a specific direction when pushing a bottle, it's essential to apply forces at the right spot on the bottle. The location where forces need to be applied to control the movement varies depending on whether the bottle is full, partially full, or empty. If a force can only be applied to the top part of the bottle, it will likely tip over unless a point on the opposite side is identified where an additional force can be applied. This counteracting force balances the initial force and facilitates bodily movement rather than tipping. Tooth movements (Definitions) There are different types of movements that can be applied to a tooth. In clear aligner therapy, it is important to know that there are different kinds of tipping movements. Among them, the simplest movement achievable with clear aligners is a straightforward crown tipping movement (Both uncontrolled and controlled tipping movements). Uncontrolled tipping (Fig 5-4a) Occurs when a force applied to the clinical crown induces a tipping movement, utilising the centre of resistance as the pivotal point. This results not only in crown tipping but also in tipping of the root apex. It's crucial to recognise that in this scenario, the centre of resistance and the centre of rotation coincide. Failing to consider this alignment can lead to unintended root movements. For example, in the case of uncontrolled lingual crown tipping, there's a risk of buccal bone fenestration when the apex tips in a buccal direction. (Fig 5-4b). Controlled tipping movements (Fig 5-5) In controlled tipping movements, the centre of rotation is shifted to the apex of the tooth during the tipping of the clinical crown. This ensures the prevention of unwanted root tipping. The same principle applies when desiring root tipping without moving the clinical crown. In a controlled root tipping movement, the centre of rotation is positioned at the incisal edge. To clarify the types of movements, \"root tipping\" refers to movement directed in a mesiodistal direction, while movements in a lingual-buccal direction are termed \"root torque” (Fig 5-6). During proclination, the crowns of the front teeth are tipped buccally, whereas retroclination involves lingual tipping of the front teeth. 91 Fig 5-4a Uncontrolled tipping Fig 5-5 controlled tipping Fig 5-4b Uncontrolled tipping 5. BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTS Translation movement or “bodily movements” Refers to parallel movements of a tooth. In the posterior segment, buccal/lingual translation is termed \"expansion.\" In the anterior segment, these movements are referred to as \"protraction\" when the tooth is moved in a buccal direction and \"retraction\" when it is moved lingually. In clear aligner treatment, there are occasions where distalisation or mesialisation movements are planned, involving the movement of most teeth in one jaw in a distal or mesial direction. In such cases, careful consideration of the bone quality and root morphology is essential. Distalisation of maxillary teeth is a common example that requires special attention to anchorage to prevent teeth from reverting to their original positions due to insufficient anchorage. Bone quality significantly influences tooth movement planning. The more compact bone found in the mandible poses challenges for movements compared to the spongious bone in the maxilla. The less dense bone in the maxilla allows for translation movements and facilitates distal or mesial movements of the maxillary molars. However, distalisation or mesialisation in the lower arch presents difficulties due to the compact nature of mandibular bone, compounded by the size and orientation of the mandibular molar roots. Predicting translation movements of mandibular molars solely with clear aligners is challenging and often results in crown tipping movements only. To ensure desired root movements, auxiliary tools such as power arms, elastics, and engagers/attachments are utilised to apply forces closer to the apex of the tooth. Additionally, applying light continuous forces over an extended period enhances the predictability and success of these movements (Fig 5-7). Rotations: Involve rotating a tooth around its own long axis, which is a simple movement but may require engagers/attachments depending on the morphology of the crown and root. Intrusion: Can be categorised into two types: 1.Absolute intrusion (Fig 5-8) 92 Fig 5-7 Translation Fig 5-6 Root torque 5. BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTS 2.Relative intrusion (Fig 5-9) Absolute intrusion involves intruding the tooth along its long axis.

Relative intrusion occurs when the clinical crowns of a tooth are tipped in a manner that gives the appearance of intrusion. It's akin to a garage door with hinges at the upper corners: when the door is opened from the bottom, it seems as though the door is being shortened or “intruded.\" Similarly, extrusions can be relative or absolute. As a last option, posterior extrusion will lead to a mandibular rotation, resulting in a decrease in overbite (Fig 5-10). In general, 1 mm of posterior extrusion leads to an increased anterior opening/decrease in the overbite of approx. 1.5-2.5 mm's. The long term stability of this type of treatment is somewhat controversial, as it will often be the muscles that define the vertical dimension. Over time a relapse should therefore potentially be expected. Movement predictability The predictability of various orthodontic movements achievable with clear aligners was delineated by T. Weir and published in the Australian Dental Journal in 2017 (Table 5-1). The table was made using a synthesis of reported data from Align Technology, and ClearCorrect. It provides an overview of the predictability of different tooth movements using clear aligners exclusively as of that time. 93 Fig 5-10 Absolute extrusion Fig 5-8 Absolute intrusion Fig 5-9 Relativ Intrusion 5.

BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTSAnchorage In the realm of biomechanics, discussing anchorage is essential, as it pertains to maintaining stability or creating resistance against reaction forces. In the context of tooth movement, forces are applied in various directions to achieve desired movements in specific directions. To achieve these desired movements effectively, it's crucial to establish a secure grip on the teeth and strategise the movements to prevent unwanted shifts. Anchorage serves as the foundation for controlled and predictable tooth movement, ensuring that forces are directed precisely to achieve treatment goals while minimising unintended consequences. Newton's third law of motion states: \"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\" This principle is akin to a tug-of-war scenario, where pulling on one side of the rope elicits a reaction in the opposite direction. In a dental context, this law is relevant when applying forces to teeth. For instance, when a force is applied to move a tooth in a certain direction, an equal and opposite force is exerted on the surrounding structures or adjacent teeth, influencing the overall treatment outcome. Understanding and accounting for these reactive forces are crucial in planning and executing orthodontic treatments effectively (Fig 5-11). Examples For example, when aiming to retract the anterior teeth in the maxilla of a patient, initiating the retraction of these front teeth will induce a reactive force on the posterior teeth in a mesial direction.

Newtons 3rd law 5. BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTSmaintaining uniform size and bone height. Applying the same force to both teeth ensures an equal amount of movement in each. Here, the force applied to one tooth generates an equal and opposite reaction in the other tooth, which can be effectively utilised to achieve the desired movement, thus leveraging the reaction force (Fig 5-12). Expansion Another example involves applying force in a transverse direction, such as in posterior expansion. When expanding the jaw on one side, the action occurs on that side, resulting in a reactive force on the opposite side, leading to expansion on both sides unless sufficient anchorage is ensured. Utilising the action-reaction forces and movements, it is feasible to plan equal expansion of the posterior left and right segments simultaneously. However, if expansion is required on only one side and not both, adequate anchorage is crucial to prevent unintended expansion in the opposing side of the dental arch. In theory, this can be achieved by expanding one tooth at a time as this will distribute the opposing forces on so many teeth, that it will not have a clinically visible effect… in theory. In reality, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not (Fig 5-13). Intrusion & Extrusion The same principle applies to intrusion and extrusion movements. For instance, if mandibular anterior teeth require intrusion to correct or enhance the curve of Spee, the aligner will encompass the clinical crowns of these teeth. Applying a downward force through the aligner transfers sufficient force to the teeth, facilitating the intrusion movement. However, it's essential for the aligner to remain securely in place on all teeth to function effectively. 96 Fig 5-12 desirable or undesirable reaction Fig 5-13 Expansion bilateral or a tooth at the time 5. BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTSAnterior intrusion The planned intrusion of anterior teeth necessitates anchorage from the posterior teeth. When the aligner pushes down on the incisors, according to Newton's third law, an equal upward movement occurs posteriorly, potentially causing the aligner to dislodge from the posterior teeth. To prevent this, adequate retention and anchorage of the aligners to the posterior teeth are essential. Posterior extrusion In scenarios where extrusion of posterior teeth is desired, leveraging the extrusion forces generated in response to the intrusive forces on the incisors is advantageous. However, if no extrusion of the posterior teeth is desired, the segments designated for anchorage must be larger than those intended for intrusion. To ensure anchorage or extrusion movements of the posterior segments, horizontal engagements need to be placed on the posterior teeth. Handling reactive forces These examples underscore the importance of consistently considering the reactive forces generated whenever an action is introduced into a treatment plan or sequence. This aspect significantly influences every treatment plan in multiple ways. Firstly It compels us to understand how to effectively utilise the reactive forces to benefit all other planned movements in the treatment plan. Leveraging these forces can optimise treatment outcomes and enhance efficiency. Secondly It highlights the reality that while aligner treatments can often achieve ideal results, there are instances where the desired outcomes may not be attainable solely through aligner therapy, even with the use of temporary anchorage devices (TADs).",

      "text": "In such cases, orthognathic surgery may be necessary to achieve the desired results. It's important to acknowledge that orthognathic surgery is a treatment modality that should always be performed collaboratively by orthodontists and maxillofacial surgeons, emphasising the interdisciplinary nature of such complex dental treatments. Having explored various scenarios where we aimed for controlled movements in specific directions, it's crucial to address situations where certain movements are undesired. In such cases, ensuring the presence of a sufficiently robust anchoring unit becomes imperative to withstand forces and limit movement to only the intended teeth or tooth. The objective is to minimise unwanted movements and avoid unintended side effects. Therefore, achieving success in any clear aligner treatment hinges on dedicating considerable effort to preventing or controlling these unwanted movements, which may occur as reactions to the required actions. In essence, the focus shifts towards meticulous management of reactive forces to maintain treatment precision and optimise outcomes. Types of Anchorage In clear aligner therapy, several options serve as anchorage to ensure stability and resist applied forces: •Adjacent Teeth:  Neighbouring teeth with or without attachments or engagers as attachment points for aligners. In clear aligner therapy, enhancing anchorage can be achieved through the use of attachments or engagers. When targeting movements in a horisontal direction, such as   97\n5. BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTSextrusions and intrusions, horisontal attachments or engagers are typically preferred. Conversely, for cases involving vertical movements like translations, rotations, and root tipping, a vertical engager is typically the preferred option. •Temporary Anchorage Devices (TADs): (Fig 5-14) Mini-implants strategically placed in the jawbone offer stable support for tooth movement and can counteract unwanted movements. TADs are screwed into the bone and can be used in many different ways as an anchorage device. As the implant does not have a periodontal ligament, it will not move but stay in place and thereby work as the ultimate anchorage device. (Which is also one of the reasons it has gained increasing popularity among orthodontists in recent years). •Interarch Mechanics:  Interarch elastics or auxiliaries, like elastic chains connecting upper and lower molars, stabilise anchorage during tooth movement. This way the opposing arch can be used as anchorage. This is often done in cases with distalisation and retraction of the maxillary front teeth, in a class II patient. In these cases, class II elastics are often used to reinforce the anchorage to prevent unwanted movements. •Implants:  Dental implants may serve as anchorage units, especially when adjacent teeth are unsuitable. Sometimes we experience adult patients who have had implants placed. If these patients present with a need for orthodontics, the existing implants may serve as a very stable form of anchorage. •Orthodontic Appliances:  Appliances such as palatal expanders or lingual arches provide stability and resist unwanted movements. Headgear is a type of anchorage traditionally used in pediatric orthodontics. It utilises external parts such as the head, neck, chin, or forehead to provide anchorage and counteract reaction forces during treatment. However, managing these forces is extremely challenging due to their external nature and variability. •Intermaxillary Fixation (IMF):  IMF temporarily immobilises the upper and lower jaws by using wires or bands to stabilise the jaw position and provide anchorage during specific orthodontic or surgical procedures. Amount of anchorage needed. “Freeman’s anchorage value diagram” (Fig 5-15), may give an idea about this. However, it is worth noting all the elements that are taken into consideration when determining the centre of resistance when looking at this diagram. The diagram shows the root surface area of each tooth, which is what needs to be taken into   98\nFig 5-14 Temporary Anchorage Device TADs\n5. BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTS\nconsideration when defining or deciding on the needed amount of Anchorage. For example, having a maxillary canine with a root surface area of 282 mm2 needs to be translated distally with a given amount of force (let’s say about 100g.)  The question arises where it is possible to achieve anchorage, and how many teeth will be needed for the desired amount of anchorage? According to Freeman's anchorage value diagram, the root surface of a maxillary premolar measures 254 mm2. With the maxillary canine having a root surface of 282 mm2, relying solely on one premolar for anchorage may not be sufficient. In this scenario, if the maxillary premolar is moved towards the canine (reaction) without additional anchorage, insufficient anchorage may result. To ensure adequate anchorage, at least one or even two more teeth must be included as part of the posterior anchorage unit. This helps prevent unwanted movements of the posterior teeth. It's important to understand that while a large posterior segment may function as an anchorage unit, this doesn't mean the unit remains completely immobile. Rather, the total movement is distributed across a broad area of root surfaces. Consequently, the clinical movement of this segment is often minimal and may not even be visibly apparent. In addition, it is worth mentioning that Freeman’s anchorage value diagram is only a guideline. This is because the tooth size, the amount of bone and the bone quality of the specific patient will have an effect on the guidelines as well. IMPORTANT: Anchorage always needs to be carefully considered when planning orthodontic tooth movements. The reaction force throughout the dental arches must be carefully analysed, evaluated and controlled to maximise the desired tooth movement and minimise the undesirable side effects. Done carefully, it can save hours of extra chair time to resolve issues or perform refinements as the clinical treatment proceeds according to plan, without tracking issues. How Jesper resolved his complex case It is never easy to admit one's own failures and shortcomings. Jesper had been treating a complex case for 12 months without success. When he showed his mistakes to Helle, she just shook her head and giggled a bit. Thankfully, no harm had been done to the patient, but Jesper learned an important lesson about Newton's third law and anchorage. Making mistakes is part of the process of becoming proficient at anything. Whenever we took on a complex, or in this case very complex,   99\nFig 5-15 Freeman’s anchorage value diagram\n5. BIOMECHANICS & TOOTH MOVEMENTStreatment, we always selected patients carefully and informed them about all potential risks and compromises. Therefore, it did not bother the patient that the treatment was prolonged by an additional 12 months, totalling 3 years. She was simply happy her smile improved day by day with “invisible” braces. Once the mistakes were identified, it was fairly easy to correct. As we typically did and still do, we worked together on the treatment plan to minimise potential risks and increase the likelihood of achieving the desired end result. Two years later, the patient received her final incisal edge bonding, a bonded retainer, and a removable retainer. 7 years on, the patient is still happy with her beautiful smile. 100",

      "text": "6.TREATMENT PLANNINGTREATMENT PLANNING The Consequences of a Hasty Plan Dr. Thompson prided herself on her efficiency. After more than a decade of practice, she had recently embraced clear aligners as a popular option for her patients. Her days were packed, her schedule tightly managed, and she knew that the clear aligner companies appreciated her streamlined approach to treatment. After all, wasn’t it simple? Just send in a request for the teeth to be \"aligned nicely,\" and wait for the aligners to arrive. One day, a new patient, Emily, came into her office. Emily was in her early thirties, with a bright smile but a hint of worry in her eyes. She wanted straighter teeth, hoping to boost her confidence at work. Dr. Thompson glanced at Emily’s records, noting mild crowding and a slightly rotated canine - nothing she hadn’t seen a hundred times before. Confidently, she filled out the aligner prescription form with her usual standards, opting for a basic treatment plan. She assured Emily it would be straightforward and quick. But as the weeks went by, complications began to arise. Emily’s teeth weren’t moving as planned. There were signs of gum inflammation, and the aligners didn’t seem to fit properly. Dr. Thompson made some minor adjustments to the treatment plan, but the problems only grew worse. Emily’s smile began to show signs of asymmetry, her bite felt uncomfortable, and she was becoming increasingly distressed. Dr. Thompson felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her chest. She realised, too late, that she had overlooked something crucial in Emily's case. Her casual approach, her assumption that this would be another routine alignment, had led her into uncharted waters. Every time Emily walked into her office, the tension was palpable, her eyes now filled with concern instead of hope. Dr. Thompson knew she had to find a solution quickly - her reputation and Emily’s trust were on the line. Treatment planning Treatment planning for clear aligner therapy extends far beyond the simple act of filling out a prescription form with the same standards each time. It is an intricate process that demands a comprehensive understanding of each patient’s unique dental and medical history, functional dynamics, aesthetic goals, and biological limitations. Although this may seem obvious, every single day all clear aligner companies in the world receive requests from doctors who basically express that they want their patient’s teeth to be \"aligned nicely”. Treatment planning stands as one of the most challenging yet pivotal disciplines preceding any orthodontic intervention. With the foundational understanding of orthodontic theories, definitions of orthodontic movements, and the essential components of an orthodontic examination covered in previous chapters, we have established the groundwork necessary for treatment planning. Armed with this knowledge, we are well-equipped to begin formulating comprehensive treatment plans tailored to individual patient needs. The clinical examination offers insights into the type of malocclusion and the patient's functional dynamics, along with an evaluation of the 106 6.TREATMENT PLANNINGsurrounding tissues. This combined information outlines the possibilities and limitations of orthodontic treatment. It's crucial to emphasise that function, aesthetics (both facial and dental), and biological factors are all key components necessary for carrying out a realistic, biologically sound, and predictable orthodontic intervention. In the realm of clear aligner therapy, setting realistic treatment goals is imperative. Not only for our patients but for ourselves as well. Our objectives encompass enhancements in facial aesthetics, functional and static occlusion, and potentially even improvements in airway dynamics. To achieve these goals effectively, it is imperative to initiate treatment with a clear vision of the desired endpoint. This encompasses not only the final orthodontic outcome but also all adjunctive treatments necessary to attain an ideal treatment result. The adage \"failing to plan is planning to fail\" rings particularly true in orthodontics. Having a well-defined endpoint before embarking on treatment is crucial. Considering potential restorative and surgical interventions alongside orthodontic possibilities establishes a solid foundation for treatment planning. This methodical approach, known as backwards planning, should ideally serve as the standard in modern dentistry. Simply asking a clear aligner provider for a patient’s teeth to be “aligned nicely” is like planning to fail. Commitment to excellence Clear aligner treatment planning represents a significant departure from conventional orthodontic treatment planning, as it is meticulously crafted with the final outcome in mind. The virtual treatment plan serves as a powerful tool, allowing practitioners to visualise and document the desired endpoint. This ensures that the end result is not merely a vague idea in the dentist's mind but a meticulously documented visualisation of the intended outcome, encompassing all planned movements. In this regard, clear aligner therapy elevates d o c u m e n t a t i o n i n o r t h o d o n t i c s t o a n unprecedented level. Working in this manner is undeniably more demanding. It places a heightened obligation on the dentist to achieve a specific end result, as deviations from the planned treatment trajectory are less forgiving. Some may find this approach daunting, as it necessitates a high degree of precision and accountability throughout the treatment process. However, it also offers unparalleled benefits in terms of treatment predictability, patient communication, and overall treatment efficacy. Facial aims Start envisioning the ideal position of the maxillary incisors in the face of the patient. Facial aesthetics often take precedence for patients seeking orthodontic treatment, encompassing not only the alignment of teeth but also the soft tissue profile and speech considerations. By meticulously analysing extraoral photos, particularly focusing on the position of the maxillary incisors within the patient's facial structure, we can discern if any adjustments are necessary to achieve an ideal aesthetic outcome. This evaluation extends beyond dental alignment to assess how changes in the position of the maxillary incisors may impact the overall soft tissue profile, including the lips, nose, and chin. Furthermore, we consider the potential influence on speech patterns, ensuring 107 6.TREATMENT PLANNING that any orthodontic adjustments maintain or improve speech clarity and articulation. Once the optimal position of the maxillary incisors is established, we evaluate whether the required movements fall within the predictable range or if a skeletal imbalance necessitates surgical intervention. This comprehensive approach ensures that orthodontic treatment not only enhances dental alignment but also optimises overall facial harmony, soft tissue aesthetics, and speech. Harmonise the mandibular incisors and canines After aligning the maxillary incisors, attention shifts to harmonising the position of the mandibular incisors to match, with the ultimate goal of achieving a harmonious facial appearance and functional occlusion. Ideally, we aim for a Class I molar and canine relationship, with a normal overjet relative to the upper incisors, and the establishment of a functional anterior and canine guidance. The illustration (Fig 6-1) depicts the envelope of discrepancy, outlining the theoretical range of movement possible for a central incisor.",

The black circle denotes the range achievable through orthodontic dental movements, while the outer teal circle represents skeletal discrepancies requiring surgical correction. The x and y axes denote the ideal position of the teeth, while the inner teal circle illustrates potential bone growth in patients who are not yet fully matured. This comprehensive analysis aids in formulating a treatment plan tailored to each patient's unique facial and dental anatomy. Recommended restrictions Clear aligner treatments conducted by general practitioners are best suited for adult patients. Unlike children, adults (age 25 and older) have completed much of their craniofacial growth, reducing concerns about treatment timing. Therefore, when treating adults, considerations regarding growth and development are less critical. Conversely, in children, the timing of orthodontic treatment is paramount due to ongoing craniofacial growth. Orthodontic interventions during this developmental stage must carefully consider the current state of skull and dental arch 108 Fig 6-1 Redrawn from Proffit WR, White RP Jr and Sarver DM (2003). Contemporary Treatment of Facial Deformity (St Louis: Mosby) 6.TREATMENT PLANNINGdevelopment. In such cases, it's essential to analyse the existing craniofacial growth patterns and dental arch morphology and plan orthodontically guided growth modifications alongside achieving an ideal occlusion. This ensures that treatment not only corrects malocclusions but also promotes favourable craniofacial growth, leading to optimal treatment outcomes. Given these considerations, we strongly advise general practitioners to focus their clear aligner treatments primarily on adult patients, where the complexities of growth and development are less prominent, and treatment outcomes are more predictable. There is in fact a reason it takes several years to become an orthodontist. Returning to the examination and analysis of facial aesthetics and the smile, it's crucial to consider the direction in which we intend to move the teeth to enhance or maintain optimal facial aesthetics for the patient. By integrating the clinical assessment with the desired facial outcomes, you can determine the feasibility of the proposed treatment. During treatment planning, the alignment of the teeth in the anterior-posterior direction, along with their vertical positioning, plays a pivotal role in identifying the most suitable orthodontic appliance and whether adjunctive auxiliaries are required. This comprehensive evaluation allows you to make informed decisions regarding the treatment approach and ensures that the proposed treatment aligns with the patient's aesthetic goals and clinical needs. Occlusal aims Occlusal aims play a crucial role, alongside facial aims, as they contribute to the overall functionality and stability of the bite. While many patients seek orthodontic treatment primarily for straighter teeth, it is important to address occlusal concerns comprehensively. Beyond simply aligning and levelling the dental arches, we should aim at achieving adequate buccal segment alignment and establish proper molar and canine relationships. Additionally, attention must be paid to the relationship between the incisors to ensure a harmonious occlusion. A well-balanced static occlusion, along with functional occlusion, including balanced anterior and canine guidance, and immediate posterior disclusion with smooth crossover, are essential components of an ideal treatment plan. However, achieving these occlusal goals may not always be possible due to various factors such as skeletal discrepancies or severe malocclusions. In such cases, the dentist and the patient must engage in open communication to determine whether it is acceptable to proceed with a",

Ultimately, the aim of any orthodontic or orthodontic-restorative treatment plan should be to optimise both the aesthetics and functionality of the occlusion. By addressing occlusal aims alongside facial aims, we can provide patients with comprehensive care that enhances both the appearance and functionality of their smile. Limiting factors Several factors can limit the success of orthodontic treatment, ranging from patient-related considerations to issues related to the malocclusion itself. Many of these factors have 109 6.TREATMENT PLANNINGalready been discussed in the chapter on orthodontic assessment. Patient-Related Factors: •Medical Health/Conditions: Underlying medical conditions or health issues may impact the feasibility of orthodontic treatment. •Dental Health: The condition of the patient's teeth and oral tissues, including the presence of decay or gum disease, can affect treatment outcomes. •Age of the Patient: Orthodontic treatment may be influenced by the patient's age, with certain treatments being more suitable for younger or older individuals. •Patient Compliance and Treatment Goals: The patient's willingness to adhere to treatment protocols and their desired treatment outcomes play a significant role in treatment success. •Patient Mindset: The patient's attitude and mindset toward orthodontic treatment can impact their overall experience and cooperation throughout the process. Factors related to malocclusion: •Skeletal Discrepancies: Severe skeletal discrepancies may present challenges in correcting malocclusions, particularly when tooth movements cannot adequately address the underlying skeletal issues. Resulting in unacceptable compromise to the soft tissues and the profile. •Tooth Size Discrepancy: Discrepancies in tooth size can affect the alignment of the teeth and may require additional interventions to achieve optimal results. •Missing Teeth: The absence of teeth can complicate orthodontic treatment and may necessitate additional procedures to address spacing or alignment issues. •Trauma to Teeth and Dentoalveolar Bone: Previous trauma or injuries to the teeth or supporting bone structures can impact the stability and movement of teeth during treatment. •Periodontal Condition: The health of the periodontium, including the gums and supporting bone, can influence the feasibility and success of orthodontic treatment. No orthodontic treatment should be started in patients with active periodontal disease. Other Considerations: •Competence Level of the Doctor: The skill and experience of the dentist in planning and performing the treatment can influence treatment outcomes. •Types of Orthodontic Appliances Available: The availability and suitability of different orthodontic appliances may affect treatment options and outcomes. •Ankylosed Teeth: Teeth that are ankylosed, or fused to the surrounding bone, may present challenges in movement during orthodontic treatment. In 110 6.TREATMENT PLANNINGaddition. Trying to move ankylosed teeth may start an external resorption process unintentionally. •Implants and Large Bridges: The presence of dental implants or extensive bridgework can significantly influence treatment planning and execution. While implants can provide excellent anchorage, they can also be positioned in ways that may not align with the overall treatment objectives. •External Resorptions: External resorptions, or the loss of tooth structure due to external factors, can affect tooth movement and stability during treatment. In conclusion, identifying and addressing limiting factors is essential in developing an effective orthodontic treatment plan tailored to each patient's unique needs and circumstances. By considering these factors comprehensively, you can optimise treatment outcomes and ensure the best possible results for your patients. Conclusion Treatment planning for clear aligner therapy is far more complex than merely filling out a prescription form with uniform standards. It requires a deep understanding of each patient's unique dental and medical history, functional dynamics, aesthetic aspirations, and biological constraints.",

By embracing this comprehensive approach, we can provide our patients with the highest standard of care and achieve predictable, successful outcomes. Partnering with Expertise for Success Determined to make things right, Dr. Thompson decided to go back to the beginning and reassess Emily’s case from scratch. She took a deeper dive into Emily’s dental and medical history, examining her facial and dental aesthetics, functional dynamics, and biological limitations. It was during this thorough evaluation that she discovered that Emily's case was far more complex than a simple request to have her teeth \"aligned nicely.” Recognising that she needed additional expertise, Dr. Thompson reached out to AlignerService. She knew that we had a team of orthodontic experts who could provide the guidance she needed to navigate this complex case. Within 24 hours, Dr. Thompson was connected with an expert from AlignerService, who worked closely with her to develop a tailored treatment plan for Emily. With the aid of the clear aligner software, it was relatively easy to visualise the treatment process step-by-step, considering not   111\n6.TREATMENT PLANNINGonly the alignment of Emily’s teeth but also the impact on her overall facial aesthetics. The experts emphasised the importance of setting realistic treatment goals and suggested a revised plan that accounted for Emily’s facial aesthetics and the biological limitations of her case. They helped Dr. Thompson understand the nuances of aligning Emily’s teeth while maintaining a harmonious balance with her facial structure. They also recommended the use of Digital Smile Design though an easy accessible 3rd party software to better visualise the desired outcome and to communicate these goals effectively with Emily. Dr. Thompson implemented the new treatment plan with confidence. She explained the revised approach to Emily, detailing the steps they would take and the realistic goals they had set. Emily, now more informed and reassured, agreed to move forward. As the treatment progressed, the results were remarkable. Emily's teeth began to align properly, her bite improved, and her confidence was restored. Dr. Thompson felt a wave of relief and satisfaction. She had regained her patient’s trust by acknowledging her initial mistake and collaborating with AlignerService to provide a higher standard of care. Emily’s smile wasn’t just “nicely aligned”; it was carefully crafted to achieve true facial harmony. This experience taught Dr. Thompson that effective treatment planning for clear aligner therapy was far more than filling out a prescription form. It required a comprehensive understanding of each patient’s unique situation, clear communication, and sometimes, the expertise of external, expert collaborators. Dr. Thompson now approaches every case with a renewed sense of diligence and commitment, understanding that achieving excellence means never taking the easy route. For every new patient, she knows the path forward isn’t just a quick prescription but a carefully crafted plan that prioritises the individual needs and goals. The lesson was clear: in orthodontics, failing to plan is planning to fail. But with a thoughtful, patient-centred approach and the support of expert partners, even the most challenging cases could become success stories. 112",

THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASETHE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE Your commitment to your patients To truly care for your patients and provide the best treatment possible, you must start with a comprehensive, unrestricted approach that allows you to leverage your expertise fully. As a dental professional, ask yourself: 1.Do you want to provide the best possible care for your patients? 2.Do you truly care about achieving optimal outcomes for them? If you answer “yes” like most other colleagues, then you must consider whether it is acceptable to compromise your treatment plan by accepting limitations set by the aligner company. Imagine being tasked with rebuilding a first maxillary molar with a fractured mesiofacial cusp and a lost MOD amalgam filling, but with severe restrictions: only using a metal matrix band designed for amalgams, no wedges or additional tools, and limited to using a flowable composite with a probe for application as your only instrument, coupled with just 2x20 seconds of light curing and no time to adjust the margins or the occlusion afterwards. Would you accept these constraints, or would you insist on using the appropriate materials and techniques to ensure the best result? Now, let’s return to clear aligner treatment planning. If you choose a clear aligner system that imposes limits on which teeth you can move, how you can move them, and the number of aligners you can use, you are not setting yourself up for success in designing an effective orthodontic treatment plan. When initiating a treatment plan with a clear aligner system that has inherent limitations, you increase the risk of not providing optimal care for your patient. Adapting your treatment to fit within the constraints of the aligner system may compromise the overall treatment outcome. Conversely, if you begin your treatment planning without any preconceived limitations, and later determine that the treatment can indeed be executed within the boundaries of an aligner system with limitations, you retain the flexibility to adapt accordingly. However, it is crucial not to impose these limitations on yourself from the outset. Start with a comprehensive plan and consider aligner limitations only when necessary. The prescription form Recognising that many prescription forms are often filled out incorrectly, we have dedicated the following pages to guide you step-by-step through making your virtual treatment planning process faster and easier. Different aligner brands We detail the process of filling out prescription forms for several different clear aligner systems. Our goal is for you to select your preferred clear aligner system and follow our guidelines. This 118 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASEsection can serve as a guide for a specific clear aligner brand of your choice, while also providing insights into the differences between 4 of the biggest clear aligner brands on the market. This knowledge will enable you to explore and experiment with different clear aligner systems should you choose to do so. It is important to note that although the process might look different from system to system, it is fundamentally the same. All aligner companies strive to make this part as easy and intuitive as possible for general dentists. However, no matter how straightforward filling out a prescription form might seem, it must be based on thorough diagnostics of the patient and high-quality data. Compromising these fundamentals will compromise the realism, safety, and predictability of the final treatment outcome. This can lead to excessive chair time correcting errors or, in the worst-case scenarios, malpractice. Therefore, we encourage you to take this part as seriously as the diagnostic data collection and analysis previously described in this book. System limitations Some aligner companies have introduced limitations to their products. The rationale for these changes is that it is safer for general dentists to perform clear aligner treatments with restrictions on molar positioning or other specific tooth movements. Ask yourself: “Who benefits the most from a clear aligner system with restrictions?” -The patient? - Rarely. -The doctor? - With restrictions, you potentially introduce compromises before you even start planning the treatment. -The industry? - Is it possible a sense of security could lead to increased sales? While it is feasible to treat some patients within the limitations set by an aligner company, we believe that starting the treatment planning process with such restrictions compromises quality and patient safety. Our recommendation is to plan your clear aligner treatments without any restrictions imposed by the aligner company from the outset. This approach ensures that your treatment plan is tailored to the individual needs of the patient, providing the highest standard of care and the best possible outcomes. You get what you ask for Your prescription form lays the foundation for how the technician or computer at the clear aligner manufacturer generates your initial digital plan. It's crucial to remember that the aligner manufacturer will follow your instructions precisely, even if the requests are clinically impossible to achieve. For example, if you have a patient who really should be treated with surgery but you ask for an idealisation of all conditions in your prescription form, the technicians will set up the teeth in an Angle Class I relationship and position the other teeth according to the company's standards for an ideal position - regardless of how unrealistic it is to reach this outcome. Remember: everything is possible on a computer screen. Confusing the clear aligner technician Clear aligner technicians need simple and very clear instructions, that are easy to follow. Consider asking for the midline to be idealised. The clear aligner technician will ask him or herself: “In relation to what?\" 119 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE1.The midline of the lower jaw? 2.The midline of the face? 3.The realism of a clear aligner treatment? Any clear aligner technician needs clear and precise instructions to understand your intent. If the technician receives broad instructions such as \"idealise the midline,\" they will attempt to satisfy you and your patient as quickly as possible. In doing so, they may make a decision that does not align with your intended request. This often leads to a digital setup that does not meet your expectations or treatment goals. Avoiding confusion Only following the regular checklists without adding your own comments generally gives the clear aligner company a relatively clear understanding of how you want your initial digital setup to be created. Adding comments in the prescription form can introduce conflicting requests, which may confuse the aligner technician or artificial intelligence. Despite this confusion, the clear aligner company will still deliver a digital setup. It is always up to the treating dentist (you) to modify the digital setup into a clinically realistic and predictable virtual treatment plan. As we have indicated previously in this book, we recommend ordering a basic digital setup from the clear aligner company and then modifying it yourself using the 3D controls in the clear aligner software.",

THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASEActionable Tips for Submitting Clear Aligner Prescription Forms 1.Start Without Preconceived Limits:  ★Always begin your treatment planning without the constraints of any aligner system in mind. Once the plan is comprehensive, you can determine which limitations you will be willing to accept in that specific case. 2.Be Precise in Your Requests:  ★Vague instructions like “align nicely” can lead to digital setups that aren’t realistic. Instead, give clear, specific instructions on tooth movements and expected outcomes. 3.Use Diagnostic Data to Guide the Plan:  ★Ensure all diagnostic information is clear, accurate, and forms the foundation of your treatment plan. 4.Avoid Overcomplicating the Instructions:  ★Too many comments or contradictory instructions can confuse technicians, leading to setups that miss your desired goals. 5.Modify the Digital Setup Yourself: ★ Use the clear aligner software to adjust the initial digital setup, rather than relying on a technician to interpret complex or detailed instructions. 6.Consider System Limitations:  ★Only after finalising your treatment plan should you consider if any system limitations, like molar movement restrictions, will impact your approach. 7.Maintain Realism:  ★Ensure that what you are asking for in the digital setup is clinically achievable and doesn't compromise the patient's overall treatment success. 8.Regularly Review and Adjust:  ★Once the treatment is underway, consistently review the progress and initiate adjustments to keep the patient’s outcome on track.

      "text": "7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTCLEARCORRECT  Step 1 - Patient creation Simply start by adding an order on the front page of your doctor portal.  On the first page of the prescription form, you create the patient case and enter the basic information of the patient.  Treat arches You determine whether you intend to address both arches or only one.  While there may be instances where treating just one arch seems appropriate, it's generally advisable to address both arches. This recommendation stems from the necessity for the maxillary and mandibular teeth to align properly to establish a stable occlusion. From a clinical perspective, situations often arise where teeth in the opposing arch require movement to achieve the treatment objectives in the arch of primary concern to the patient. In most cases, restricting treatment to a single arch results in numerous compromises, as the opposing arch must harmonise with the treated arch. Moreover, since there is no disparity in treatment cost regardless of whether one or both arches are treated, there is no rationale to opt for a single-arch approach (Fig 7a-1). Chief complaint In this section, you document the chief complaint provided by the patient. This includes pertinent details such as the patient's treatment objectives, their primary concerns, and the motivations behind seeking treatment. Additionally, when collaborating with external specialists, it serves as a valuable space to outline initial considerations regarding the desired ortho-restorative outcomes envisioned by you - the treating doctor. Using your own words, you document the primary concerns expressed by the patient, which may include: •The patient's treatment objectives and desired outcomes. •The specific issue or concern that is most significant to the patient. •The underlying reasons motivating the patient to seek treatment. •And other relevant factors influencing the patient's decision to pursue treatment. Step 2 - Records The second page of the ClearCorrect prescription form is where the IO-scans, photos and X-rays of the patient are being uploaded (Fig 7a-2).  Uploading and connecting the right IO-scan to the patient is the first step. There are no limitations to the choice of IO-scanner. As long as the scanner is able to export the scans as STL files the scans can be used with ClearCorrect.  Uploading bite registrations alongside scans of the teeth offers significant advantages as the aligner technicians do not have to guess how to set the occlusion of the patient or do it based on your clinical photos.  The process of uploading STL files is straightforward: you can drag and drop, copy and paste, or browse to select the files.   With a Trios or Cerec scanner, intraoral scans can be uploaded directly to the doctor portal from the scanner. If your practice uses one of these   122\n7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTscanners and you prefer this option, ensure that the scanner is connected directly to ClearCorrect. PVS impressions An alternative to IO-scans is sending PVS impressions. These impressions must be made in single-use plastic trays since the trays will not be returned to the practice. Impressions of both the upper and lower jaws are necessary, regardless of whether a single-arch or dual-arch treatment is planned. Without impressions of both arches, it is impossible to plan any movements of one arch that will properly align with the opposing teeth. Due to the shipping time required for the impressions, the setup process takes longer before it is ready for inspection and review. Aligners will fit the teeth regardless of the type of impression sent (digital or physical), provided the impressions are of high quality and include all teeth and at least 3 millimetres of soft tissue above or below the gum line.

Photo Upload Click the photo tab to open the section where the photos are being uploaded. It is as easy to upload the photos as the IO-scans. Simply drag and drop, copy past or browse for the files. It is possible to upload up to 20 photos, but the most important ones are the 3 extraoral and 5 intraoral photos as shown on the page with graphic illustrations. The photos can be added in the field provided for each of the 8 mandatories photos, or they can be uploaded as a bulk upload (Fig 7a-3). X-rays Click the X-ray tab to upload the X-rays you find relevant to the case. It is optional to upload X-rays to the doctor portal. However, as we have described previously they are mandatory in the medical records of the patient as they play a vital role in the treatment planning. If you work with a treatment planning service provider (such as AlignerService.com). It is highly recommended that you also upload at least a panoramic X-ray of the patient. That will enable the remote team of dentists and orthodontists to create a comprehensive treatment plan, that is realistic, safe and predictable. 124 Fig 7a-2 second page of the prescription form in ClearCorrect IOS 7.

THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTThe X-rays will visualise which implants and bridges that are not to be moved or can serve as anchorage during the orthodontic treatment. In addition, the X-rays show the bone levels and any visual apical pathology. The external specialists and the doctor in the practice can then communicate about what needs to be taken care of prior to the orthodontic treatment and how.(Fig 7a-4). Delegation In regard to the data handling of the prescription form. A dental assistant or dental hygienist trained to do this should be able to fill out the first two steps of the prescription form and upload all relevant scans, photos and X-rays. Once the person uploading the data click “next” in the lower right corner of the screen. All previous actions are being saved. Step 3 - Treatment Approach The third page of the prescription form outlines the treatment approach for the patient. At this stage, it is necessary to specify the patient's type of dentition. Does the patient have mixed dentition, is it a child, or is it an adult with permanent dentition? (Fig 7a-5). Mixed dentition Treating children with a mixed dentition simply requires ticking off the mixed dentition button. Treatment plans for patients with mixed dentition will automatically be considered full arch correction cases. In these instances, the instructions should be followed as if treating a full arch case. The only difference will be in the clear aligners received at the dental office, which will feature recognisable eruption bubbles in areas where permanent teeth are about to emerge. 126 Fig 7a-5 Dentition type 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTThese eruption bubbles are designed to leave space for the teeth to erupt. As previously highlighted in this book, we recommend that general dentists refrain from treating children and refer them to an orthodontist instead. Consequently, we do not provide further descriptions of the treatment planning process for children with mixed dentitions. If you have an adult patient with residual primary teeth, the case should be marked as \"permanent\" dentition. Later, at step 4 of the prescription form, you should indicate these primary teeth under \"teeth not to be moved\" to prevent them from being moved, to avoid root resorption. Treating adult patients you select the \"permanent\" dentition option and click “next.” The following step offers the choice between planning an aesthetic treatment or a full arch treatment (Fig 7a-6). Treatment approach At this stage, you have the option to choose between an aesthetic approach or a full arch correction. This choice does not impose any treatment limitations; it is simply an instruction for the ClearCorrect technician who will create a digital setup based on your preference. Once you receive the digital setup from ClearCorrect, you can move all teeth as you prefer without any restrictions. In other words, the chosen treatment approach only limits the technician's creativity in setting up the teeth in the initial digital setup. Aesthetic Approach The aesthetic treatment approach will limit the initial movements to the anterior zone only, with no planned molar movements. The ClearCorrect technicians follow this basic protocol when planning an aesthetic treatment: •Align and level the dental arch, limited to anterior and premolar correction. •Improve upper and lower midlines up to 1mm. •Improve overjet and overbite up to 2mm. •Apply IPR, engagers, and expansion as necessary. 127 Fig 7a-6 Treatment approach 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTWhen the aesthetic preference is chosen, a box appears with additional choices to be made. Aesthetic - base protocol (Fig 7a-7) Should the ClearCorrect technician improve the overjet and/or overbite? The clinical situation often indicates the need to improve these parameters. If there is no need for improvement and they are already perfect, simply do not tick the boxes, indicating to the technician to maintain the present relationships. Once the setup is ready for inspection, you have the ability to change the position of all teeth, including the molars, using the 3D controls or comments in the ClearPilot software. This flexibility allows for easier navigation between different options and the ability to change your mind without ordering a completely new plan. Optional treatment protocols (Fig 7a-7) In addition to the standard protocol, there are a number of optional treatment protocols. No IPR Avoiding IPR will most often lead to compromises in the treatment outcome. No Engagers Without engagers, the predictability of tooth movements will be compromised. Engagers help the aligners grip the teeth firmly, ensuring they move in the desired directions. Excluding engagers increases the risk that some teeth will not track according to the virtual treatment plan. Tracking issues raise the likelihood of needing one or more revisions. Each revision requires new IO-scans and new photos to be sent to ClearCorrect. With the new data, ClearCorrect can create a new treatment plan to correct the deviations. This plan must then be reviewed by the treating dentist or an online collaborator to ensure it is realistic, safe, and predictable. Once the new plan is approved, new aligners will be sent to the practice, which should then guide the teeth to the desired end result. This is of course time consuming and therefore less desirable. 128 Fig 7a-7 Aesthetic approach 7.",

In this case, you can inform the technician by ticking the \"do not move premolars\" box. However, it is important to consider Dr. Larry Andrews' fourth key (see Chapter 4) - rotated teeth take up more space. If there is crowding among the anterior teeth, it is generally advisable to move the premolars and potentially the molars too, to avoid extensive IPR. On the other hand, avoiding IPR but allowing movement of the premolars might lead to over-expansion of the dental arches, causing teeth to be pushed partially out of the bone. Over time, this can lead to severe recessions if the expansion. Level to the gingival margin If selected, this option signifies that the teeth will be arranged to align with the guidelines for optimal aesthetics, prioritising the positioning of the marginal gingiva levels over the alignment based solely on the incisal edges. It's crucial to understand that opting for this approach will likely necessitate incisal edge bonding following the teeth alignment process. This preference is typically favoured, considering that altering the gum line is more challenging than adjusting the incisal edges. Please note that to ensure this correction harmonises with the patient's facial structure, it is crucial to align the occlusal plane parallel to a horizontal reference, such as the interpupillary line. This step must be completed before making any digital corrections to the anterior teeth. Midline improvements Choosing the aesthetic option limits a lot of movements. Improving the midline is possible to some extent. In these aesthetic cases it can be a great help to remember the standard protocol for the aesthetic option with ClearCorrect is: “improve upper and lower midline with up to 1 millimetre”. There are 3 midline options (Fig 7a-7) :  1.Improve upper midline only 2.Improve lower midline only  3.Maintain existing midlines. The choice should be made based on the initial diagnosis of the patient in combination with your treatment objectives. Keep in mind that this limitation is only for the aligner technicians working on your case. Once the technician completes the initial digital setup, you can edit it to include any movements and adjustments for all the teeth as you see fit. Setting these initial limitations can simplify the process, helping you avoid having to correct numerous changes made by the technicians that don't align with your treatment objectives or protocols. Full arch Approach When opting for a full arch correction approach (Fig 7a-6), additional information needs to be included in the prescription form. More factors must be considered to ensure you receive a digital setup from the aligner technician that closely aligns with your treatment goals. Providing this extra information gives ClearCorrect technicians a better chance of configuring the initial digital setup to match your objectives. If the first digital setup is closely aligned with the treatment goal, it simplifies the process for you to   129",

With this information, options for treating or maintaining these conditions will appear. It is crucial to evaluate both the molar and canine relationships, especially in cases of class II or class III deviations, as anchorage considerations during treatment become significant. If auxiliaries are required, you need to determine whether cutouts for the use of elastics will be necessary. If so, tick the box and remember to specify this in the instructions on the next page.

THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTmay be unrealistic to expect a complete correction without surgery. If the molar relations are not initially class I but the occlusion is stable, it may not be necessary to alter the molar relationship, especially in adult patients, to avoid over treatment. However, if indicated by the patient’s profile or if the overjet is significant enough to benefit from changing the molar relationship to class I, then instructing ClearCorrect technicians to optimise/improve the molar relationship is appropriate. Class II molar relationships are commonly corrected through techniques such as distalisation of maxillary teeth. Class III molar relationships are most often corrected using Interproximal Reduction (IPR). If excessive IPR is required to achieve a satisfactory occlusion, surgery may be the best treatment option. This approach is preferable to extracting premolars, which can restrict space for the tongue, increase the risk of airway problems, and involve challenging tooth movements to close the extraction sites. (Please remember that tooth movements may appear straightforward in the digital setup, but the reality in the patient’s mouth can be entirely different.) Distalisation The responsibility for treatment planning, including the decision to perform distalisation, lies with the treating doctor and not the clear aligner technicians. As the overseeing clinician, you should have the expertise to determine when distalisation is appropriate and when it is not. Distalisation involves bodily movements of the teeth to shift them distally. It's crucial to assess whether such movements can be achieved predictably. When planning distalisation, understanding the predictability of the desired movements is paramount. In the maxilla, distalising movements are generally more predictable due to the nature of the bone. The soft trabecular bone in the maxilla facilitates distalisation, enhancing the predictability of treatment outcomes. Therefore, with careful planning, achieving distalisation in the maxilla is feasible. Planned distalisation in the maxilla invariably demands ample anchorage. However, this anchorage requirement isn't specified by the technicians or indicated in the software. Consequently, the software may suggest smooth movements throughout treatment without acknowledging the need for anchorage. This underscores the importance of the treating doctor thoroughly diagnosing the patient, devising a clear t r e a t m e n t p l a n , a n d c o m p r e h e n s i v e l y understanding the forces necessary to achieve the desired outcome. During treatment planning and the meticulous analysis and optimisation of the digital setup, it's imperative to ensure that the intended movements are attained while preventing unintended ones. This involves deciding on the method of anchorage, whether through elastics attached to teeth (identifying which teeth to involve, when to implement them, for how long, and the rationale behind their use) or through TADs (Temporary Anchorage Devices ie. Mini implants). Distalising or mesialising teeth in the mandible poses greater challenges compared to the maxilla. The mandibular bone is denser, and the root morphology impedes movements in mesial or distal directions. Patients requiring such movements, including root translations, 131 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTnecessitate special precautions and auxiliary support. Improving the canine relation is typically more straightforward. It often involves interproximal reduction (IPR) between the premolars, which usually yields a reasonable enhancement of the canine relation with a relatively straightforward treatment approach. Dental conditions. ClearCorrect has made some illustrations in order for the general dentist to be able to identify the dental orthodontic conditions of the patient. Each dental condition ticked will open a box with additional choices to be made specifically regarding the dental conditions identified by the practitioner. This is in order to guide the ClearCorrect technician during the preparation of the initial digital setup. Completing this section is not mandatory, but it is advisable to ensure that the initial digital setup aligns as closely as possible with the desired final outcome. By selecting various conditions, the different fundamental treatment protocols provided by ClearCorrect will be accessible. This allows the treating doctor to supplement instructions for the ClearCorrect technician by checking the desired boxes in the optional treatment protocol (Fig 7a-9). It is worth noting that even though the software does restrict the selection of two contradictory choices. It is still possible to choose contradicting treatment protocols in cases with several dental conditions. Basic ClearCorrect treatment protocols: Spacing: Close all spaces. (typically retracting all teeth until the spaces have been closed). It is worth remembering that teeth are naturally being positioned in the space with an equilibrium between the muscle forces and soft tissues affecting them. Besides the obvious risk of having a negative effect on the patient’s soft tissue profile. This means that if all spaces are being closed by retraction it may be really hard to retain the teeth in this position. Even a bonded retainer in combination with an aligner on top may not be sufficient to retain the teeth in place. This increases the risk of relapse considerably. In addition, retracting all the anterior teeth may affect the space for the tongue in a way that restricts the airways. This will then induce an airway disorder, that can potentially lead to general health issues. Crowding: Expansion, proclination, and IPR as needed. It is always worth noting that aligner technicians do not consider biological limits when planning these movements. Factors such as bone, soft tissue, the patient’s profile, and others are not accounted for. Technicians move the teeth according to their protocol, often resulting in end positions and movements that should be avoided. For crossbite correction, anterior and posterior crossbites should be corrected by buccal/lingual movements of the crossbite and retraction/contraction in the opposite arch. However, planned posterior crossbite correction beyond 2mm may be unpredictable.",

In cases with a need for more than 3 millimetres of extrusion or intrusion, it may be wiser to use fixed appliances as these will be able to perform the wanted movements in a very short time. Compared to clear aligners.  Open bite: Relative extrusion by lingual tipping and/or pure extrusion of anterior teeth.  In such instances, identifying the etiology of the open bite is crucial. (Developmental, allergies, habits, former orthodontic treatment, TMD, etc.) Tongue habits are always an issue when dealing with open bites and should be diagnosed and sometimes treated elsewhere prior to orthodontic treatment planning.  In addition, inducing an airway restriction with orthodontic closure can be a risk.  Worsening TMD is also a possible risk factor.  Expansion and proclination Addressing various dental conditions through expansion and proclination necessitates careful consideration. Expansion and proclination are among the most frequently employed movements to rectify dental issues. However, it is essential to evaluate whether it is appropriate to perform the necessary amount of expansion and/or proclination on the patient. This assessment typically involves examining clinical photos to determine the suitability of these treatment approaches based on the individual's specific dental anatomy and clinical presentation. Factors to consider when proclining the anterior teeth  To be able to know if the front can be proclined, the biotype should be evaluated on the clinical photos. If the root contour can be recognised in the mandibular front, it indicates that the gingiva and the bone are very thin. A thin biotype heightens the risk of developing recessions when proclining the teeth or performing buccal/labial translation movements. Such movements may inadvertently push the roots beyond the confines of the bone, posing a risk to the tooth's stability and periodontal health. It is advisable to look out for and possibly prevent planned “round tripping” as this movement protocol may increase the risk of recessions considerably.  Round tripping refers to the process in clear aligner treatments where teeth are moved out of their original positions to enable fast and easy handling of IPR. Once IPR has been performed the teeth are moved back again to achieve the desired final alignment. This protocol often involves initially pushing the teeth beyond their final target positions and subsequently pulling them back to create a more ideal alignment and occlusion. Risks and Implications: Tooth movements that involve pushing teeth out of the bone envelope can lead to bone loss, particularly if the teeth are moved too far buccally or lingually. This bone loss can be accompanied by gingival recession as the gum tissue follows the receding bone.  While round tripping can sometimes be necessary to achieve specific treatment goals, it imposes significant risks, particularly the risk of inducing gingival recessions.  Considerations for Dental Arch Expansion  Expanding the dental arches typically involves a buccal translation of the posterior teeth. Planning such movements necessitates assessing the potential risk of inducing recessions. This risk   134\n7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTarises when the teeth are pushed beyond the confines of the bone during expansion. Factors to consider include: •Biotype:  Evaluate the thickness of the gingiva and bone (biotype) to determine the likelihood of recession development. Thin biotypes are associated with an increased risk of recession formation during expansion. •Existing recessions:  Take into account any pre-existing recessions, as these indicate vulnerability to further recession development with excessive expansion. •Degree of expansion:  Exercise caution to avoid excessive expansion, particularly in cases of thin biotype or existing recessions, to mitigate the risk of recession formation. By carefully considering these factors, it is possible to plan and execute dental arch expansion procedures while minimising the risk of recession development and optimising treatment outcomes. Midline  Consider whether the midline should be maintained or corrected. Filling out this part of the prescription form is optional, but we strongly recommend it. Providing this information increases the likelihood that the setup will closely match the desired treatment goal (Fig 7a-10). Step 4 - Additional Instructions At this stage of the prescription form, specific information and requests for the digital setup are added (Fig 7a-11). This includes specifying planned extractions, indicating which teeth to move or not, and identifying where to avoid engagers or leave spaces open. Completing this part requires a well-developed treatment plan prior to filling out the prescription form. Additionally, it is essential to understand what can and cannot be achieved with clear aligners. Without a treatment plan and a solid understanding of clear aligner therapy, accurately completing this section can be very challenging. Wear schedule The wear schedule dictates the duration for which the patient wears each set of aligners. This schedule can be customised in the treatment preferences. However, determining an optimal wear schedule can be challenging, particularly without prior experience with clear aligners and before reviewing a digital setup. t's important to note that the wear schedule does not impact the virtual treatment plan.

      "text": "7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTTIP: New users of clear aligners may find it challenging to determine which teeth to move and which to leave stationary. In cases of uncertainty regarding biomechanics or clinical boundaries, it is advisable to block out the second and third molars. This restriction limits the technician's options for tooth movement, preventing overly complex adjustments that may lead to an unrealistic digital setup. Once the initial digital setup is ready for review, adjustments can then be applied to improve the patient's bite on the stationary teeth. However, this approach is only suitable for patients where the initial diagnostic overview and tentative treatment planning indicate such an opportunity. Avoid engagers In certain cases, it may be preferable to omit an engager on a specific tooth, and this is where such information is communicated to the technician. Simply clicking on the tooth will designate it to be omitted. Reasons for avoiding engagers may include patient preference, such as not wanting an engager on an anterior tooth or challenges in bonding a composite engager to a ceramic surface. In situations where it's easier to skip the engager, especially if anchorage for movements of other teeth allows for it, it may be considered. Following orthodontic treatment, the crown or veneer can often be replaced to compensate for some missed movement. However, it's important to note that omitting an engager on a tooth increases the risk of tracking issues, particularly if complex or major movements are planned. Aligners may have difficulties grasping the tooth and applying planned forces, reducing the likelihood of movement in the desired direction. Planned extractions or missing teeth If it's determined before starting treatment that certain teeth will be extracted, it's crucial to mark them as such. When the most distal tooth in the dental arch is extracted, it shortens the aligner accordingly, as the aligner's length is determined by the last tooth shown in the digital setup. In cases where a tooth within the dental arch is extracted, leaving a space between two teeth, the aligner will be designed with a pontic or a bar to replace the missing tooth. In the aesthetic zone, a pontic can be filled with a composite material or painted with a tooth-coloured concealer to camouflage the missing tooth. When using composite material, it's important to leave space around the neighbouring teeth to allow them to move freely instead of being immobilised by the composite pontic. This ensures optimal tooth movement and alignment during treatment. Leaving spaces If there are spaces between the teeth that needs to be maintained, these areas are to be marked in the prescription form.  TIP:  If there are multiple diastemas in the anterior part of a dental arch, where redistribution of the space is preferred for minimally invasive restorative closure after orthodontic treatment, it is recommended to specify this in the additional instructions. It's important to indicate how much space is needed around each tooth. It's worth noting that while orthodontic closure of diastemas is often feasible, maintaining closure can be challenging regardless of the retention method employed. Additionally, there's a risk of inducing a breathing disorder due to potential   138\n7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTairway restriction. Therefore, most adult patients with multiple diastemas will benefit from an ortho-restorative approach. Digital smile design can greatly aid in patient communication and visualisation of orthodontic tooth positioning prior to planned restorative procedures, facilitating a comprehensive treatment plan.    Additional information/instructions. In this section, you can communicate messages to the technicians regarding the preferred end results of the treatment setup. TIP: •Use bullet points with short, direct instructions for clarity. •Be specific about desired movements to ensure accurate implementation. •Select a reference tooth for alignment instructions to maintain consistency. •Avoid using general terms like \"Align the teeth\" to prevent misinterpretation.  By providing clear and specific instructions in this manner, you can help the technicians understand and implement the desired treatment outcomes effectively.  Remember the aligner technicians do what you instruct them to do.  In cases with unclear or broad instructions, the technicians will make a digital setup according to how they think “alignment of the teeth” for instance is to be interpreted. When doing this they do not consider biology, aesthetics or function as they have no prerequisites for doing this.  Here is an example of a written instruction to the technicians.  Dear technician Please apply the following instructions. 1.Redistribute the spaces in the upper front leaving 0.3mm space between each tooth. 2.Set the midline of the upper arch at the initial mesial surface of tooth 11. 3.Add 10° of buccal crown tipping to tooth 41 and use that as a reference for aligning the lower front. Thank you Step 5 - Finishing the prescription form At this stage, the prescription form has been completed, and it's time to review and approve the terms and conditions along with other legal documents. Simply check the boxes next to the terms and conditions after thoroughly reading them before submitting the initial setup. By accepting the terms and conditions, ClearCorrect is granted permission to use the records to aid in creating the initial digital setup. Once all terms and conditions have been accepted, the case can be submitted. At this point, the technicians have all the necessary information to begin creating the initial digital setup. It's important to note that the digital setup returned from the technicians is intended to facilitate the creation of the final virtual treatment plan. The initial digital setup must be meticulously reviewed to ensure it aligns with the treating doctor's goals, the patient's desires, and a clinically realistic, safe, and predictable treatment plan. In approximately 90-95% of cases, modifications to the digital setup are necessary to achieve these objectives.   139",

This will direct you to the patient database, where you can create a new patient case by entering their basic information. (Fig 7b-1). Step 2 - Choose Package Type Click \"Next\" to proceed to the page where you’ll select the package type. The options available will depend on whether you’re using the SureSmile Aligner software or the SureSmile Ortho software. For the Aligner software, you can choose between Full-Service Aligner Staging and SureSmile Retainers. The Ortho software offers additional options, including Theoretical Training, Do-It-Yourself Aligner Staging, Full-Service Aligner Staging, Advanced Diagnostics, and SureSmile Retainers (Fig 7b-2). Regardless of which version you use, we recommend selecting the Full-Service Aligner Staging. This option is fully compatible with other clear aligner brands, providing a versatile solution. Step 3 - Upload scan In this step, you’ll also upload and connect the appropriate IO scan to the patient’s profile. There are no restrictions on the choice of IO scanner; as long as the scanner can export scans as STL files, they will work with SureSmile. Uploading the STL files is straight-forward. Simply drag and drop, copy and paste, or browse for the files. If you wish to merge a CBCT scan with the IO scan, you can do so by ticking the appropriate box, though be aware of the additional cost associated with this feature (Fig 7b-3). 141 Fig 7b-1 Patient information Fig 7b-2 Package type 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTStep 4 - Photos/X-rays Photo Upload It is as easy to upload the photos as the IO-scans. Drag and drop, copy past or browse for the files. You upload the 3 extraoral and 5 intraoral photos as mentioned on the page. In SureSmile uploading X-Rays is optional (Fig 7b-4). As previously discussed, x-rays are essential components of a patient’s medical records, playing a critical role in the treatment planning process. If you collaborate with an external treatment planning service provider, it is highly recommended that you also upload at least a panoramic x-ray of the patient. This allows the remote team of dentists and orthodontists to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that is realistic, safe, and predictable. X-rays provide a clear visualisation of which implants and bridges should remain stationary or can be used as anchorage during orthodontic treatment. Additionally, they reveal bone levels and any visible apical pathology. This enables the external specialists and the in-practice doctor to communicate effectively about any necessary pre-orthodontic care and how to proceed accordingly. Step 5 - Dental Examination In the Dental Exam section the patient's dentition type has to be decided. This includes noting if the patient has missing teeth, teeth scheduled for extraction, or teeth that should remain stationary during treatment. Both the Aligner and Ortho software include this step, although the interface and layout may differ slightly depending on which software you are using (Fig 7b-5). In the Aligner software, you'll receive visual cues to assist with treatment planning. For example, if you designate a tooth for extraction, it will be marked with an arrow. Teeth that shouldn't be moved will be indicated with a lock icon, and 142 Fig 7b-3 Upload scan Fig 7b-4 Step 4 photos/X-ray upload 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECT missing teeth will appear as transparent with a dotted outline. For mixed dentition cases, the Ortho software offers additional functionality. You can specifically indicate which teeth have not yet erupted, which is essential for accurately planning treatment in patients with mixed dentition. The software automatically identifies mixed dentition based on the scan. Both the Aligner and Ortho software can handle mixed dentition cases, provided you're confident in managing such treatments. In these cases, the aligners will include recognisable eruption bubbles in areas where permanent teeth are expected to erupt. These bubbles are strategically designed to leave space for the incoming teeth, ensuring a smoother treatment process. Step 6 - Prescription Aligner Software In the Aligner software, the prescription form is straightforward with minimal options to consider (Fig 7b-6). First, you select which arch to treat and specify whether you want to focus on the full arch, from premolar to premolar, or from canine to canine. When the treatment excludes molar movement, the technicians are restricted to limit the treatment to the anterior zone. However, even after the setup is complete and ready for inspection, you can still adjust the molar positions using the 3D controls or by adding comments within the software. This flexibility allows you to explore different treatment options without needing to request an entirely new plan. Once the aesthetic setup is finalised, the molars can always be included in the treatment plan if necessary. Attachments Next, you decide whether or not to include attachments in the setup. If you're scanning a patient before removing existing attachments from a previous treatment, you can choose to keep them. This can save valuable chair time when dispensing new aligners. However, it's crucial to ensure that the existing attachments are in good condition before opting to reuse them. Opting out of attachments compromises the predictability of tooth movements. Attachments are essential for helping aligners grip the teeth firmly and guiding them in the desired directions. Without attachments, there's a higher risk that some teeth may not track according to plan, leading to potential tracking issues. These issues often necessitate one or more revisions, each requiring a new scan and updated photos to be sent to SureSmile. The revised data is then used to create a new treatment plan to address any deviations. This new plan must be carefully reviewed by the treating dentist or an online 143 Fig 7b-5 Step 5 Dental Examination Ortho (left) Aligner (right) 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECT collaborator to ensure it remains realistic, safe, and predictable. Once the revised plan is approved, new aligners, tailored to the patient's current clinical situation, will be sent to the practice, with the aim of guiding the teeth to the desired end result. If your treatment plan involves only minor adjustments, such as shifting one or two incisors with minimal IPR, it may not be necessary to move the premolars.

      "text": "However, keep in mind Dr. Larry Andrews' Fourth Key from Chapter 4: rotated teeth occupy more space.\n\nIf there is significant crowding among the anterior teeth, neglecting to address the premolars (and potentially the molars) could lead to excessive IPR, which may be suboptimal. Conversely, if you avoid IPR but allow the movement of the premolars, you risk over-expanding the dental arches. This could push teeth partially out of the bone, increasing the risk of severe recessions over time. When setting up your treatment plan, you can initially choose whether to include IPR. If you decide to avoid it, be prepared for potential compromises in the treatment outcome. Remember, you can always adjust the setup later if needed. If you plan to use elastics, it might be challenging to determine the exact requirements at the outset. However, you have the flexibility to modify this aspect of the setup later on. Click on \"More Settings\" to input specific preferences for the following parameters (Fig 7b-7): •Midline: Maintain or Correct •Archform: Maintain, Expand, or Constrict •Overjet: Contact or Gap •Overbite: Maintain or Correct Midline Improvements When choosing a treatment plan, such as canine to canine or premolar to premolar, there may be 144 Fig 7b-6 Step 6 Aligner software prescription form Fig 7b-7 More settings 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTlimitations on the extent of movements achievable. Enhancing the midline is possible to some degree within these parameters. For aesthetic cases, refer to the standard protocol for midline improvement using facial references (see Fig 4-11, 4-22). If you have specific preferences for the midline, please detail them in the additional notes. Overjet and Overbite Consider whether the SureSmile technician should adjust the overjet and overbite. Often, clinical situations necessitate improvements in these parameters. If the current overjet and overbite are already ideal and no changes are needed, simply leave the boxes unchecked to instruct the technician to maintain the existing relationships. Additional Notes Finally, provide any additional instructions in the notes section (Fig 7b-6). For aesthetic-focused treatments, it’s crucial to address the gingival margin. This involves arranging the teeth to align with optimal aesthetic guidelines, prioritising the marginal gingiva levels over the alignment of the incisal edges. Opting for this approach may require incisal edge bonding post-alignment. This is often preferred since adjusting the gum line is more complex than modifying the incisal edges. Clearly communicate this preference in the additional notes. Tips for Clear Communication: •Use bullet points for concise, direct instructions. •Be specific about desired movements to ensure precise implementation. •Designate a reference tooth for alignment instructions to ensure consistency. •Avoid vague terms like “Align the teeth” to prevent misinterpretation. By providing clear and specific instructions, you help ensure the technicians understand and execute the desired treatment outcomes effectively. Remember, the aligner technicians act based on your instructions. Unclear or broad directions may result in a setup based on their interpretation of terms like “alignment of the teeth,” without consideration for biological, aesthetic, or functional factors. Here is an example of a written instruction to the technicians. Dear technician Please apply the following instructions. 1.Redistribute the spaces in the upper front leaving 0.3mm space between each tooth. 2.Set the midline of the upper arch at the initial mesial surface of tooth 11. 3.Add 10° of buccal crown torque to tooth 41 and use that as a reference for aligning the lower front. 4.The main concern is _____ Thank you The additional information you provide significantly enhances the SureSmile technicians' ability to create a virtual treatment plan that closely aligns with your goals. By ensuring that the initial virtual setup is as accurate as possible, you facilitate a smoother process for finalising the plan. This approach increases the likelihood of achieving a clinically realistic and predictable outcome. Step 6 - Prescription Ortho Software When working with the SureSmile Ortho software (Fig 7b-8), it's important to recognise that more detailed information needs to be added to the prescription form compared to the SureSmile 145 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECT aligner software. This is because there are additional factors to consider in order to ensure that the digital setup closely aligns with your treatment goals. Despite the increased complexity, the process still begins with selecting which arches to treat. At this initial step, we strongly recommend against setting a time limit or restricting treatment to just one arch. The patient is either committed to the treatment or they are not. Ultimately, it’s your professional reputation on the line if the treatment doesn’t go as planned. One of the key advantages of the SureSmile system is its lack of movement limitations, which allows for greater flexibility in treatment planning. However, this also presents a challenge: the aligner system's flexibility enables both technicians and clinicians to make extensive adjustments to the setup, which can increase the risk of incorporating unrealistic movements. Midline Consider whether the midline should be maintained or corrected? (Fig 7b-9). Make sure to examine the midline of both the face, the maxilla and the mandible well (Fig 4-11,4-22). This will help you to fill out this part of the prescription. When this is done correctly, the setup will more likely come closer to the desired treatment goal. Archform Expansion and Proclination: Key Considerations Addressing various dental conditions through expansion and proclination requires meticulous planning and assessment. These are among the most frequently employed techniques to correct dental issues, but their appropriateness must be carefully evaluated for each patient. This typically involves a thorough examination of clinical photographs to determine whether the proposed 146 Fig 7b-8 Step 6 Ortho software Prescription form 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECT amount of expansion and/or proclination is suitable, taking into account the patient's unique dental anatomy and clinical presentation (Fig 7b-10). Considerations for Proclining Anterior Teeth Before deciding to procline the anterior teeth, it's essential to evaluate the biotype using clinical photos. If the root contours are visible in the mandibular anterior region, this suggests that the gingiva and underlying bone are very thin. A thin biotype increases the risk of gingival recession when proclining teeth or performing buccal/labial translation movements. Such movements can inadvertently push the roots beyond the bony envelope, jeopardising the stability of the teeth and their periodontal health. Considerations for Expanding the Dental Arches Expanding the dental arches generally involves buccal translation of the posterior segments. Planning these movements requires careful consideration of the potential risks, particularly the likelihood of inducing gingival recession. This risk is heightened when teeth are pushed beyond the bony confines during expansion. Key factors to consider include: •Biotype: Assess the thickness of the gingiva and bone. Thin biotypes are more prone to 147 Fig 7b-9 Step 6 Ortho - Midline Fig 7b-10 Step 6 Ortho - Archform 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTrecession, especially during expansive movements. •Existing Recessions: Identify any pre-existing gingival recessions, as these areas are more susceptible to further recession with additional expansion.",

By carefully considering these factors, it is possible to plan and execute dental arch expansion procedures while minimising the risk of recession development and optimising treatment outcomes. Spacing:  A common practice in orthodontic treatment is to close gaps by retracting the teeth until all spaces are eliminated. However, it is crucial to carefully assess the potential consequences of this method. Teeth naturally rest in positions where the forces from muscles and surrounding soft tissues are balanced. Altering this balance by retracting all the teeth to close spaces can result in several problems. One significant concern is the difficulty of maintaining the new positions of the teeth. Even with the use of bonded retainers and additional aligners, keeping the teeth stable after retraction can be challenging. Additionally, excessive retraction may adversely affect the patient's soft tissue profile, potentially changing the natural contours of their face. An equally important consideration is the possible impact on the airway. Retracting the front teeth can reduce the space available for the tongue, which may lead to airway constriction. This constriction could contribute to airway disorders, potentially resulting in more serious health issues over time. Given these concerns, many adult patients with multiple diastemas may benefit more from an ortho-restorative approach, which can offer a more balanced solution by integrating both orthodontic and restorative treatments. Specific Instructions for Space Maintenance If there are specific spaces between the teeth that need to be preserved, it's crucial to clearly communicate this to the technicians in the treatment notes. TIP:  When addressing multiple diastemas in the anterior region of the dental arch and aiming to redistribute space to support minimally invasive restorative post-orthodontic treatment procedures, it is crucial to include this information in the additional instructions. Clearly specify the exact amount of space required around each tooth to achieve the desired outcome and accommodate the planned restorative work. Avoid providing detailed explanations for the need for space, as most aligner technicians may not understand these arguments, which could lead to confusion and potentially create new issues in the digital setup. The Role of Digital Smile Design Digital Smile Design (DSD) proves to be an great tool in such cases. It enhances patient communication by providing a clear visualisation of orthodontic tooth positioning prior to any restorative procedures. This capability helps in creating a comprehensive, patient-specific   148",

Please be aware that incorporating DSD in a dental practice has a steep learning curve.  Crowding: Key Considerations When addressing dental crowding, the most common strategies include expansion, proclination, and IPR as needed. However, it is crucial to recognise that aligner technicians typically do not account for biological limits when planning these movements. Factors such as bone structure, soft tissue integrity, and the patient's facial profile are often overlooked. As a result, the planned tooth movements may reach end positions or involve actions that should be avoided to prevent adverse outcomes. Crossbite: Correction Strategies and Risks Correcting anterior and posterior crossbites typically involves buccal or lingual movements of the affected teeth, coupled with retraction or contraction in the opposing arch. However, it's important to note that digitally planned posterior crossbite corrections beyond 2 mm may be unpredictable to achieve  clinically. For more complex movements, such as the translation of molars and premolars, careful planning is essential. If the teeth do not track as intended, there is a risk that a simpler movement, like uncontrolled tipping, may occur instead. Uncontrolled tipping can be particularly problematic in cases involving arch expansion, as it may lead to the development of an anterior open bite. This occurs because the palatal cusp tips tend to move coronally when a maxillary tooth tips buccally. It's important to understand that these risks and their management is rarely fully accounted for in the technician's protocol, underscoring the need for careful oversight and additional planning of complex cases. Angle classification Molars and Cuspids Bilaterally First, decide whether you want to maintain or correct the patient's Angle classification, molar relationships, and premolar relationships (Fig. 7b-11). \n  149\nFig 7b-11 Angle classification \n7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTIt is essential to assess both the molar and canine relationships, especially in cases of class II or class III discrepancies, as anchorage management becomes a critical factor in treatment planning. If auxiliaries will be needed, consider whether cutouts for elastics will be required. If so, provide specific instructions in the note field, indicating where you need cutouts for buttons or a slit/hook for the elastic attachment. When evaluating the molar relationship, consider the overall clinical scenario. Achieving a class I relationship in adult patients with a class II or class III malocclusion can be challenging and may not always be realistic. If the molar relationship is not initially class I but the occlusion is stable, altering it may not be necessary, particularly in adult patients. However, if the patient's profile or a significant overjet suggests a benefit from adjusting the molar relationship to a class I, then instruct the SureSmile technicians accordingly. Class II molar relationships are typically corrected by distalising the maxillary teeth. Distalisation The responsibility for treatment planning, including decisions regarding distalisation, rests solely with the treating doctor rather than the clear aligner technicians. As the overseeing clinician, it is essential to use your expertise to determine when distalisation is appropriate and feasible. Distalisation involves moving the teeth in a distal direction, and it is vital to evaluate whether these movements can be achieved predictably. In the maxilla, distalisation is usually more predictable,  compared to the mandible, due to the nature of the bone. The softer trabecular bone in the maxilla allows for easier tooth movement with proper planning. However, successful distalisation in the maxilla requires significant anchorage, which is often not explicitly defined by the technicians or within the software. As a result, the software might suggest smooth movements throughout treatment without considering the necessary anchorage. This underscores the critical role of the treating doctor in thoroughly diagnosing the patient, creating a detailed treatment plan, and understanding the forces needed to achieve the desired outcomes. When planning treatment, it's important to ensure that the intended movements are executed while avoiding unintended consequences. This includes deciding on the anchorage method, whether by using elastics attached to specific teeth (and determining which teeth to use, when, for how long, and the reason for their use) or by employing Temporary Anchorage Devices (TADs). Distalising or mesialising teeth in the mandible is more challenging than in the maxilla due to the denser bone and root morphology, which complicates movements in mesial or distal directions. Patients requiring such movements, especially root translations, will need special precautions and additional support. Improving the canine relationship is generally more manageable and often involves IPR between the premolars. This technique typically enhances the canine relationship with a relatively straightforward approach. Resolutions (Fig 7b-12) You will determine whether to perform IPR based on the needs of the case. IPR is frequently required to address tooth size discrepancies, which can be assessed through Bolton analysis (Fig 4-8).   150",

THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTOnce the initial treatment setup is ready for review, minor adjustments can be made to fine-tune the patient’s bite on the stationary teeth. However, this approach is most appropriate for cases where the initial diagnostic assessment and preliminary treatment planning indicate that it is a suitable option. Planned extractions or missing teeth If it is decided before starting treatment that certain teeth will need to be extracted, it is crucial to clearly indicate these teeth in the treatment plan. When extracting the most distal tooth in the dental arch, the aligner will be shortened accordingly, as its length is determined by the last tooth included in the setup. In cases where a tooth is extracted from within the dental arch, leaving a gap between two adjacent teeth, the aligner can be designed either to include a pontic or to leave the space open. If a pontic is used, it can be filled with composite material or painted with a tooth-coloured concealer to blend with the surrounding teeth. When using composite material for a pontic, it is important to ensure there is enough space around the adjacent teeth to allow for their movement. This prevents the composite pontic from restricting the movement of the neighbouring teeth and helps maintain proper alignment and function throughout the treatment. Occlusal plane (Fig 7b-13) Deep bite:  At this step in the prescription form, it is necessary to specify how the teeth should be corrected in relation to the occlusal plane, whether it involves a deep bite correction or an open bite correction. If the goal is to level the curve of Spee, it is important to consider whether this should be achieved by only intruding the anterior teeth or by combining this with extruding the posterior teeth to provide better anchorage. It should be noted that intrusions and extrusions beyond 2-3 millimetres are generally unpredictable and can take a significant amount of time to accomplish with clear aligners. In cases where more than 3 millimetres of extrusion or intrusion is required, it may be more effective to use fixed appliances, as these can achieve the desired movements more efficiently and in a shorter time frame compared to clear aligners. Open bite:  Identifying the aetiology of an open bite is crucial. (Developmental, allergies, habits, former orthodontic treatment, TMD, etc.) Tongue habits are always an issue when dealing with open bites and should be diagnosed and sometimes treated elsewhere.

However, the treatment has to be part of the orthodontic treatment plan from the beginning. In addition, inducing an airway restriction with orthodontic closure can be a risk. Just like worsening TMD is also a possible risk factor. Special Instructions (Fig 7b-14) Avoiding attachments In some cases, it may be preferable to avoid placing attachments on certain teeth. When this is necessary, it’s important to clearly communicate this to the technician by noting the specific teeth to be excluded. Common reasons for avoiding attachments include patient preferences, such as not wanting attachments on anterior teeth or difficulties in bonding a composite attachment to a ceramic surface. There are situations where skipping an attachment might be more practical, particularly if the overall treatment plan allows for sufficient anchorage from other teeth. In these cases, the crown or veneer can often be adjusted or replaced after orthodontic treatment to address any minor discrepancies in movement. However, it’s crucial to be aware that avoiding an attachment on a tooth increases the risk of tracking issues, especially if complex or significant movements are required. Without the attachment, aligners will often not transfer the necessary forces to the tooth, which can reduce the effectiveness of the treatment and make it more challenging to achieve the desired treatment outcomes. Aligner Trim Type SureSmile offers a choice between a straight trim line and a scalloped trim line for the aligners, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, the desired height of the trim line can be specified (Fig. 7b-15). It is important to remember that the higher the trim line, the greater the retention of the aligner. However, if the trim line extends more than 2 mm above the gingival margin, the retention can become so strong that removing the aligners may be difficult, even in the absence of attachments. 153 Fig 7b-14 Special instructions 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECT Step 7 - Finishing the prescription form In the final section of the prescription form, it is time to review the order summary and proceed with placing the order. (Fig 7b-16). The technicians now have all the necessary information to begin creating the initial setup. It is important to understand that the digital setup provided by the technicians is a preliminary foundation for developing the final virtual treatment plan. The initial digital setup must be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it aligns with the treating doctor's objectives, the patient's preferences, and is clinically realistic, safe, and predictable. In approximately 90-95% of cases, 154 Fig 7b-16 Order summery Fig 7b-15 Special instructions Aligner Trim Type 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - CLEARCORRECTmodifications to the initial digital setup are required to meet these goals. Once the digital setup is modified and submitted to SureSmile, production of the final virtual treatment plan will commence. When the revised digital setup is ready for review, a notification will be sent to the practice email, informing the doctor of its availability. The status of the case can be monitored at any time in the patient database via the doctor portal. 155 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGNINVISALIGN At this point, it should be clear that we do not endorse the use of restricted clear aligner systems, as they significantly increase the risk of malpractice. This is the primary reason why we have not included any guidelines for iGo or iGo Plus in this book. Instead, below you will find our recommendations for completing the Invisalign prescription form using a comprehensive account. Step 1 - Add new patient To begin, navigate to the front page of your doctor portal and add a new patient. This is where you'll create the patient case. Start by entering the patient's basic information into the system. If you're using the Invisalign Photo App, you can also create the patient case and enter their basic information directly within the app. This streamlines the process and integrates seamlessly with your doctor portal. Clinical conditions In this section, we record the patient's chief complaint and key details. This includes: •Treatment Objectives and Desired Outcomes: Document the patient's goals for treatment and what they hope to achieve. •Primary Concerns: Note the specific issue or concern that the patient finds most significant. •Motivations for Seeking Treatment: Include the reasons driving the patient to seek orthodontic care. •Relevant Factors: Capture any additional factors that are influencing the patient's decision to pursue treatment. When collaborating with external specialists, this section also provides valuable context for outlining initial considerations and desired ortho-restorative outcomes as envisioned by the treating doctor. Record Uploads Upload scans and photos of the patient. You may choose to do this now or wait until the other parts of the prescription form is complete. The process for uploading these records is the same in both cases. Once the patient profile is created, initiate treatment by clicking on the \"START\" button. Step 2 - Patient Type Selection The first step i the selection of the patient type (Fig 7c-1). Different patient types offer various options and features tailored to their specific needs. Here’s a brief overview: •Adult: Adult patients with permanent dentition. Should there be any deciduous teeth you mark them later in the prescription form. •Child: This option allows for flexibility in treatment timing. Alignment can be initiated during a phase with mixed dentition and the treatment can be paused to monitor growth before resuming. Features include eruption bubbles and compensators for the eruption of permanent teeth, as well as placeholders. •Teen: This option shares some features with the 156 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGN Child type but does not allow for treatment pauses. It includes the ability to add mandibular advancement (e.g., a twin block) to facilitate mandibular growth more aggressively than class II elastics. Mixed dentition When treating children or teenagers with mixed dentition, either the \"Child\" or \"Teen\" option should be selected. Treating a child with all permanent teeth erupted, requires the standard adult patient type when filling out the prescription form. For patients with mixed dentition, treatment plans need to account for both tooth eruptions and patient growth. Aligners for mixed dentition cases will feature eruption bubbles in areas where permanent teeth are expected to emerge. These bubbles are designed to provide the necessary space for the teeth to erupt properly. In cases involving adult patients with one or more deciduous teeth, proceed with the “adult!” plan. It is important to determine whether the deciduous tooth will be extracted or reduced in size using IPR in the virtual treatment plan. Consider the relatively thin enamel of deciduous teeth compared to permanent teeth when making this decision. In addition due to the high probability of external resorptions on deciduous teeth it should always be considered either not to move theses teeth or plan extractions and replacements prior to the virtual treatment planning process.",

Selecting the Treatment for Your Adult Patient When determining the type of treatment for an adult patient (Fig 7c-2), the Invisalign system offers several options: 1.Invisalign Smile Architect: This option allows you to utilise Invisalign’s integrated Smile Design software, which may help in planning and visualising the desired treatment 157 Fig 7c-1 Choose patient type 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGN outcomes. 2.Vivera Retainers: Retainers are not included in any of the Invisalign packages. If the primary goal is to maintain the current tooth positions without further adjustments, you can opt for Vivera retainers only. This is typically done once your treatment has ended and the patient has had his or her final restorative treatment. 3.I n v i s a l i g n C l e a r A l i g n e r s: F o r a comprehensive orthodontic treatment, this will typically be the main choice. Select the option that best fits the patient’s needs and treatment goals. Step 3 - Treatment option The Invisalign system offers different treatment options (Fig 7c-3). As previously mentioned, we aim to avoid limitations when creating virtual treatment plans. This is one reason we do not use iGo, which restricts the range and extent of tooth movements. Similarly, the comprehensive portfolio has its own set of limitations based on the selected treatment option. Choosing an option based on the number of aligners can limit the amount of movement achievable within that timeframe. If you are confident that the treatment can be effectively managed with the selected option, you can proceed with it. However, if there is any uncertainty, we recommend opting for the comprehensive treatment option. You can always adjust to a different option if it appears suitable after reviewing the ClinCheck. In the following sections, we will demonstrate how to complete the prescription form for a comprehensive treatment. Recommendation For the initial ClinCheck, we recommend avoiding the imposition of a time limit or restricting the treatment to just one arch. Decisions should be based on the patient’s needs and willingness rather than arbitrary constraints. Ultimately, your dental license is at stake if the treatment does not proceed as planned. This approach can be challenging because, while the aligner system provides significant flexibility for both technicians and clinicians to make a wide range of adjustments, it also increases the risk of including unrealistic movements in the ClinCheck. Careful planning and oversight are crucial to ensure that the proposed movements are achievable and aligned with the treatment goals. 158 Fig 7c-2 Choose product type 7.

      "text": "experienced clinicians with extensive case histories (1000+ cases) can only provide an educated estimate, which remains speculative. Typically, time limitations are influenced by patient expectations, but patients often lack detailed knowledge about orthodontic treatments. Therefore, we strongly advise against promising a specific treatment duration, as it is not possible to guarantee this outcome reliably. Arch to treat It needs to be decided whether to address both arches or just one. Although it is possible to focus treatment solely on a single arch with clear aligners, it is generally advisable to treat both arches. This recommendation is based on the need for the maxillary and mandibular teeth to align properly to establish a stable occlusion (Fig 7c-4). From a clinical standpoint, there are often situations where movement in the opposing arch is necessary to achieve the desired results in the primary arch. In most cases, limiting treatment to one arch leads to compromises, as the opposing arch needs to align with the treated arch to ensure overall treatment success. While choosing to treat only one arch may result in a small discount with Invisalign, complications 159 Fig 7c-4 Arch to treat Fig 7c-3 Choose treatment option 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGNcan arise if you later need to address the opposite arch. In such cases, you would need to start the treatment planning process anew and purchase an additional package, making the overall treatment more expensive. Additionally, it is rarely possible to pass these extra costs on to the patient, as it is the professional’s responsibility for the initial decision to treat only one arch. Tooth movement restrictions (Fig 7c-5) In the digital planning process, you can designate certain teeth to remain stationary by selecting them to be blocked from movement. This prevents the technician from planning any adjustments for those teeth. Reasons for restricting movement during the digital planning phase may include the presence of implants, bridges, or ankylosed teeth. Additionally, limiting tooth movement can help control the technician's adjustments in specific areas of the dental arch, leading to a more realistic treatment setup. Understanding the technician's workflow enables the treating doctor to order an initial digital setup with a minimal need for modifications. TIP: For clinicians that are not used to work with clear aligners, determining which teeth to move and which to keep stationary can be challenging. If you are uncertain about biomechanics or clinical constraints, consider blocking out the second and third molars. This restriction limits the technician's options and helps prevent overly complex adjustments that could result in an unrealistic treatment setup. Once the initial setup is ready for review, you can make minor adjustments to refine the patient's bite on the stationary teeth. This approach is suitable only when the initial diagnostic overview and preliminary treatment planning suggest it as a viable option. Attachments (Fig 7c-5) In certain cases, it may be preferable to omit attachments on specific teeth, and this information should be communicated to the technician by 160 Fig 7c-5 Tooth movement restrictions and attachments 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGNclicking on the tooth to designate it for omission. Reasons for avoiding attachments might include patient preferences, such as not wanting an attachment on an anterior tooth or challenges with bonding a composite attachment to a ceramic surface. If omitting attachments is feasible - especially if other teeth provide adequate anchorage - this option can be considered. After orthodontic treatment, it may be possible to replace crowns or veneers to address any missed movement. However, omitting attachments increases the risk of tracking issues, particularly with complex or major movements.",

      "text": "Aligners may struggle to secure and apply the necessary forces to the tooth, which can impede achieving the desired movement. Choosing to forgo attachments compromises the predictability of the treatment. Attachments assist aligners in gripping the teeth firmly and guiding them in the intended directions. Without attachments, some teeth may not track as planned, increasing the risk of requiring additional aligners. Each time additional aligners are needed new scans and photos need to be sent to Invisalign. With this updated data, Invisalign will create a revised treatment plan to address any deviations. This new plan must be reviewed by the treating dentist or an online collaborator to ensure it is realistic, safe, and predictable. Once approved, new aligners will be produced and sent to the practice. Anterior-Posterior (A-P) relationship First, assess the Angle classification by examining the molar and canine relationships of the patient (Fig 7c-6). Understanding these relationships will \n  161\nFig 7c-6 Anterior-posterior (A-P) relationship\n7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGNhelp determine the most suitable treatment options to address or maintain these conditions. It is crucial to evaluate both molar and canine relationships, especially in cases with Class II or Class III deviations, as anchorage considerations become particularly important during treatment. If auxiliary devices will be needed, consider whether cutouts for elastics are required. If so, tick the appropriate box and click on “Specify in Precision Cuts Interface” to define the locations for cutouts for buttons or hooks for elastics. If you do not specify this, the Invisalign technicians will follow their standard protocol. Regarding molar relationships, consider the overall clinical scenario. Achieving a Class I relationship in adult patients with existing Class II or Class III malocclusions can be challenging, and complete correction may not always be realistic. If the molar relationships are not initially Class I but the occlusion is stable, it may not be necessary to alter the molar relationship, especially in adult patients. However, if the patient’s profile indicates that adjusting the molar relationship could be beneficial - such as when there is a significant overjet - then instructing Invisalign technicians to improve the molar relationship is appropriate. Class II molar relationships are commonly corrected using techniques such as distalisation of the maxillary teeth. Distalisation The responsibility for treatment planning, including the decision to perform distalisation, lies with the treating doctor and not the clear aligner technicians. As the overseeing clinician, you should have the expertise to determine when distalisation is appropriate and when it is not. Distalisation involves bodily movements of the teeth to shift them distally. It's crucial to assess whether such movements can be achieved predictably. When planning distalisation, understanding the predictability of the desired movements is paramount. In the maxilla, distalising movements are generally more predictable due to the nature of the bone. The soft trabecular bone in the maxilla facilitates distalisation, enhancing the predictability of treatment outcomes. Therefore, with careful planning, achieving distalisation in the maxilla is feasible. You have to option to make the distalisation more predictable by making it sequential. With or without cutouts for elastics. Planned distalisation in the maxilla invariably demands ample anchorage. However, this anchorage requirement isn't specified by the technicians or indicated in the software. Consequently, the software may suggest smooth movements throughout treatment without acknowledging the need for anchorage. This underscores the importance of the treating doctor thoroughly diagnosing the patient, devising a clear t r e a t m e n t p l a n , a n d c o m p r e h e n s i v e l y understanding the forces necessary to achieve the desired outcome. During treatment planning and the meticulous analysis and optimisation of the digital setup, it's imperative to ensure that the intended movements are attained while preventing unintended ones. This involves deciding on the method of anchorage, whether through elastics attached to teeth (identifying which teeth to involve, when to implement them, for how long, and the rationale behind their use) or through TADs (Temporary Anchorage Devices). Distalising or mesialising teeth in the mandible poses greater challenges compared to the maxilla. 162\n7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGN\nThe mandibular bone is denser, and the root morphology impedes movements in mesial or distal directions. Patients requiring such movements, including root translations, necessitate special precautions and auxiliary support. Improving the canine relationship is typically more straightforward. It often involves IPR between the premolars, which usually yields a reasonable enhancement of the canine relation with a relatively straightforward treatment approach. Overjet Consider how you would like to finish the overjet (Fig 7c-7). Some like to have anterior coupling others do not. When working with aligners and especially deep bite cases it can be a good idea to not aim for anterior coupling and end with an overjet of about 1,5-2 mm (This is the Invisalign standard when choosing “show resulting overjet after alignment”). 163\nFig 7c-7 Overjet\nFig 7c-8 Overbite\n7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGNOverbite (Fig 7c-8) Deep bite:  The standard Invisalign approach involves intruding the upper and lower anterior teeth and setting a flat occlusal plane. This means idealising the Curve of Spee according to orthodontic standards, which results in a flat occlusal plane. It is important to note that intrusions and extrusions beyond 2-3 millimetres can be unpredictable and may take considerable time to achieve with clear aligners. For movements exceeding 3 millimetres, using fixed appliances may be more effective, as they can achieve the desired results more quickly compared to clear aligners. Open Bite:  To address an open bite, consider relative extrusion by lingual tipping and/or pure extrusion of the anterior teeth. Identifying the underlying cause of the open bite is crucial. Potential etiologies include developmental factors, allergies, habits, previous orthodontic treatment, and temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Tongue habits are often a contributing factor to open bites and should be diagnosed and managed before planning orthodontic treatment. Additionally, be cautious of potential airway restrictions that may arise from orthodontic closure, as well as the risk of worsening TMD. Understanding these factors will guide you in creating a more effective treatment plan and anticipating potential challenges. Bite ramps  Bite ramps are features incorporated into aligners to help lift the bite in deep bite cases. By elevating the bite, bite ramps facilitate posterior extrusion due to the disocclusion they create during treatment. There are several methods for planning bite ramps in aligners (Fig 7c-9). An essential and often overlooked detail is ensuring that the mandibular incisors actually come into contact with the bite ramps. If the overjet is too large, the bite ramps will be ineffective, as they will not properly engage the incisors. Proper planning and placement of bite ramps are crucial for achieving the desired bite adjustment and improving the overall effectiveness of the treatment. 164\nFig 7c-9 Bire ramps",

      "text": "7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGNMidline Midline Alignment Improving the midline can be beneficial, especially in aesthetic cases. To achieve the best results, it’s helpful to align the upper midline with the facial midline. Decide whether the midline should be maintained as is or corrected. If you opt to allow the resulting midline to be determined by the technician or AI, the midline will be adjusted based on what fits best with the dental arch rather than strictly aligning with the facial midline. Properly executed, this approach will more likely align the ClinCheck closer to the desired treatment goal (Fig 7c-10). Crossbite Correction To correct anterior and posterior crossbites, use buccal or lingual movements and retraction or contraction in the opposing arch. Note that correcting posterior crossbites beyond 2mm may be unpredictable. For more complex movements, such as translating molars and premolars, it’s crucial to plan carefully. If the teeth do not track correctly, simpler movements might be expressed instead, which can lead to complications. Uncontrolled tipping movements, for instance, may result in an anterior open bite when arch expansion is involved. This occurs because palatal cusp tips move coronally when a maxillary tooth is tipped buccally. Risk management for such complications is not included in the technician’s standard protocol, so careful planning is essential. Treatment Considerations for Spacing and Crowding (Fig 7c-11) Crowding: When addressing crowding, it's important to consider Dr. Larry Andrews' fourth key, which states that rotated teeth occupy more space. If anterior teeth are significantly crowded, it is generally advisable to move the premolars (and potentially the molars) to minimise the need for IPR. Neglecting to move the premolars and focusing solely on IPR can lead to both excessive tooth movement and enamel reduction. The 165 Fig 7c-10 Midline and crossbite 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGN excessive tooth movements may cause over-expansion of the dental arches and potentially push teeth outside their bony support, increasing the risk of severe recessions over time. Aggressive IPR may lead to odd tooth shapes and an increased risk of caries over time. Spacing: When closing spaces, the typical approach involves retracting all teeth until the gaps are closed. However, it’s crucial to recognise that teeth naturally position themselves in equilibrium with muscle forces and soft tissues. Closing all spaces through retraction may make it challenging to retain the teeth in their new positions. Even with a bonded retainer combined with aligners, retention may be insufficient. Additionally, retracting all anterior teeth can reduce space for the tongue, potentially leading to airway restrictions. This can result in airway disorders, which may have broader health implications. In summary, when treating crowding or spacing issues, consider the balance between moving teeth, managing space, and ensuring long-term retention and airway health. Managing Spaces Leaving or Redistributing Spaces: You can choose to leave or redistribute spaces by selecting the \"edit specific spaces\" option. This allows you to adjust the size of the spaces according to your treatment goals (Fig 7c-12). 166 Fig 7c-11 Spacing and crowding 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGNTIP: For cases with multiple diastemas in the anterior region, where space redistribution is preferred for minimally invasive restorative closure post-orthodontic treatment, specify this in the additional instructions. Indicate the exact amount of space required around each tooth to guide the treatment effectively. While orthodontic closure of diastemas is often achievable, maintaining this closure can be challenging regardless of the retention method used. Additionally, there is a risk of inducing airway restrictions, which may lead to breathing disorders. Therefore, an ortho-restorative approach is often beneficial for adult patients with multiple diastemas. Utilising Digital Smile Design (DSD) may enhance patient communication and the visualisation of orthodontic tooth positioning before restorative procedures, resulting in a more comprehensive treatment plan. Invisalign offers its “Smile Architect” solution, which is based on DSD principles. While this feature has theoretical benefits, we have found that it often falls short compared to traditional DSD protocols. The limitations inherent in Invisalign's software can restrict the full potential of DSD, making a conventional approach to DSD more effective in many cases. However, the DSD protocol most often has a steep learning curve. Addressing Crowding Treatment Approaches for Crowding: Crowding is commonly managed through expansion, proclination, and IPR as needed. It's important to recognise that aligner technicians often do not account for biological limits, such as bone and soft tissue constraints or patient profile specifics. Their planning may focus solely on protocol-driven movements, which can sometimes result in end positions and movements that may not be ideal. Careful consideration and adjustments are necessary to avoid these potential issues and achieve a successful treatment outcome. Expansion and proclination Addressing various dental conditions through expansion and proclination requires careful consideration and planning. These movements are commonly used to address dental issues, but it's crucial to assess their appropriateness for each individual patient. This evaluation typically involves analysing clinical photos to determine if expansion or proclination is suitable based on the patient's unique dental anatomy and clinical presentation. Factors to consider when proclining anterior teeth Biotype Assessment: •Thin Biotype: If the root contours are visible in the mandibular anterior region, it indicates a thin biotype, where the gingiva and bone are delicate. Proclining teeth in such cases increases the risk of developing periodontal recessions. Thin biotypes can lead to the roots extending beyond the bone boundaries, compromising tooth stability and periodontal health. 167 Fig 7c-12 Edit specific spaces 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - INVISALIGNFactors to consider when expanding dental arches Buccal Translation of Posterior Segments: •Biotype: Assess the thickness of the gingiva and bone (biotype) to gauge the risk of recession. A thin biotype is linked to a higher risk of recession during expansion. •Existing Recessions: Consider any pre-existing recessions, as these may indicate a susceptibility to further recession with additional expansion. •Degree of Expansion: Be cautious with the extent of expansion, especially if the biotype is thin or if there are existing recessions, to prevent further recession development. Careful consideration of these factors allows for effective planning and execution of dental arch expansion procedures while minimising the risk of recession and optimising treatment outcomes. Risks of avoiding IPR If you opt not to use IPR, be aware that this choice may lead to compromises in the treatment outcome. While IPR can help in managing space and alignment, avoiding it might necessitate other adjustments that could impact the overall result. Extractions Indicating Planned Extractions: When extractions are part of the orthodontic treatment plan, clearly indicate which teeth will be extracted (Fig 7c-13). By carefully evaluating these factors and making informed decisions, you will be able to achieve more predictable and successful treatment outcomes. Planned extractions or missing teeth If it's determined before starting treatment that certain teeth will be extracted, it's crucial to mark them as such.",

These impressions must be taken using single-use plastic trays provided by Invisalign. Both the upper and lower jaws need to be captured, regardless of whether you're planning a single-arch or dual-arch treatment. If Invisalign receives an impression of only one arch, it will be impossible to plan any movements for that arch that properly align with the opposing teeth. Keep in mind that because the impressions are physically shipped, the process takes longer, delaying when the setup is ready for review. The aligners will fit the teeth correctly whether digital or physical impressions are used, as long as the impressions are of high quality.

Step 6 - Prescription Summary At this stage, you've completed the prescription form, and it's time to review the details you've entered. By submitting the form, you grant Invisalign permission to use these records to create the initial ClinCheck and treatment setup. It’s crucial to understand that the ClinCheck provided by the technicians serves as a starting point for developing the final treatment plan. The initial ClinCheck should be carefully reviewed to ensure it aligns with the treating doctor’s objectives, meets the patient’s expectations, and reflects a clinically sound, safe, and predictable treatment plan. In about 90-95% of cases, adjustments to the ClinCheck are required to achieve these goals. Once submitted, Invisalign will begin producing the ClinCheck. When it is ready for review, a notification will be sent to the practice email, alerting the doctor that the ClinCheck is available. The status of the case can be monitored at any time through the patient’s profile in the doctor portal. 174 Fig 7c-18 Discount 7.

However, as we have described previously they are mandatory in the medical records of the patient as they play a vital role in the treatment planning. If you work with a treatment planning service provider (such as AlignerService.com). It is highly recommended that you also upload at least a panoramic X-ray of the patient. That will enable the remote team of dentists and orthodontists to create a comprehensive treatment plan, that is realistic, safe and predictable. The X-rays will visualise which implants and bridges that are not to be moved or can serve as anchorage during the orthodontic treatment. In addition, the X-rays show the bone levels and any visual apical pathology. The external specialists and the doctor in the practice can then communicate about what needs to be taken care of prior to the orthodontic treatment and how. Step 3 - scans Uploading and connecting the right IO-scan to the patient is the first step. There are no limitations to the choice of IO-scanner. As long as the scanner is able to export the scans as STL files the scans can be used with Spark (Fig 7d-4). The process of uploading STL files is straightforward: you can drag and drop, copy and paste, or browse to select the files. With some scanners, intraoral scans can be uploaded directly to the doctor portal from the scanner. If your practice uses one of these scanners and you prefer this option, ensure that the scanner is connected directly to Spark. 176 Fig 7d-3 Photos and x-ray import in Spark 7.

First of all, it is difficult to know how long a treatment will take prior to starting a virtual treatment plan. Doctors having performed 1000+ cases may be able to make a qualified estimation. However, it is after all guesswork. Most often a time limitation is dictated by a patient. However, patients do not know anything about orthodontic treatments. As a consequence, we strongly advise not to promise the patients the treatment can be finished within a certain amount of time. As there is no way to guarantee this. Our recommendation is to never set a time limit. Aligner Material Spark offers two different materials for their clear aligners: TruGEN and TruGEN XR.

TruGEN XR may be the preferred option when a stiffer aligner is needed, such as in cases involving significant root movement or during refinements focused on achieving the final, precise adjustments. However, keep in mind that a more rigid material can be more challenging to place on crooked teeth with a difficult path of insertion. Arches to treat When planning treatment, determine whether to address both arches or only one (Fig 7d-6). While there may be cases where treating a single arch appears sufficient, it is generally advisable to treat both arches. This approach ensures proper alignment of the maxillary and mandibular teeth, which is essential for establishing a stable occlusion. Clinically, there are often situations where achieving the desired outcome in one arch requires movement of teeth in the opposing arch. Restricting treatment to a single arch usually leads to compromises, as the opposing arch must harmonise with the treated one. Moreover, since the cost remains the same regardless of whether 178 Fig 7d-5 Prescription - select product 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - SPARK one or both arches are treated, there is no cost-based rationale for choosing a single-arch approach. One or Two Arches? While it is possible to plan the alignment of only the maxillary or mandibular arch, we recommend not limiting treatment to a single arch in the initial planning phase. Such limitations often necessitate unnecessary compromises that could be avoided by treating both arches. E n s u r e t h e p a t i e n t u n d e r s t a n d s t h a t comprehensive treatment involving both arches is generally more effective. Emphasise that this approach minimises compromises and increases the likelihood of a successful outcome.

We will review these clinical preferences later. Tooth-specific instructions Here, you can specify which teeth you do not want to move, as well as indicate any teeth that should not have attachments. You can also decide whether or not to include bite ramps (Fig 7d-7). Unmovable If the treatment plan involves only minor movement of one or two incisors that requires minimal interproximal IPR, moving the premolars 179 Fig 7d-6 Arches to treat and like to clinical preferences Fig 7d-7 Tooth specific instructions 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - SPARKor molars may not be necessary. In such cases, you can inform the technician by marking the teeth that should not be moved. However, it's important to consider Dr. Larry Andrews' fourth key (see Chapter 4) - rotated teeth take up more space. If there is crowding among the anterior teeth, it is generally advisable to move the premolars and, potentially, the molars as well to minimise extensive IPR. During digital planning, you can designate teeth that should remain stationary throughout treatment by marking them as unmovable. This will guide the technician to avoid planning any adjustments for those specific teeth. There are several reasons for preventing movement in the digital planning phase, such as the presence of an implant, bridge, traumatised, or ankylosed tooth. Additionally, restricting tooth movements can help limit the technician’s flexibility in certain areas of the dental arch, leading to a more realistic digital setup.",

      "text": "Understanding the technician's workflow allows the responsible doctor to create a more precise virtual treatment plan with minimal modifications needed. TIP: New users of clear aligners may find it challenging to decide which teeth to move and which to leave stationary. In cases of uncertainty regarding biomechanics or clinical boundaries, it is advisable to block out the second and third molars. This restriction limits the technician's options for tooth movement, preventing overly complex adjustments that could lead to an unrealistic digital setup. Once the initial digital setup is ready for review, further adjustments can be made to optimise the patient's bite on the stationary teeth. However, this approach is best suited for cases where the initial diagnostic overview and tentative treatment planning suggest it as a viable option. No attachments In certain cases, it may be preferable to omit attachments on a specific tooth, and this is where such information is communicated to the technician. Simply clicking on the tooth will designate it to be omitted. Reasons for avoiding attachments may include patient preference, such as not wanting attachments on an anterior tooth or challenges in bonding a composite attachment to a ceramic surface. In situations where it's easier to skip the attachment, especially if anchorage for movements of other teeth allows for it, it may be considered. Following orthodontic treatment, the crown or veneer can often be replaced to compensate for minor missed movements. However, it's important to note that omitting an attachment on a tooth increases the risk of tracking issues, particularly if complex or major movements are planned. Aligners may have difficulties grasping the tooth and applying planned forces, reducing the likelihood of movement in the desired direction. Without attachments, the predictability of tooth movements will be compromised. Attachments help the aligners grip the teeth firmly, ensuring they move in the desired directions. Excluding attachments increases the risk that some teeth will not track according to the virtual treatment plan. Tracking issues raise the likelihood of needing one or more revisions. Each revision requires new IO-scans and new photos to be sent to Spark. With the new data, Spark can help create a new digital setup to correct the deviations. This plan must then be reviewed and modified by the treating dentist or an online 180 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - SPARKcollaborator to ensure it is realistic and predictable. Once the new plan is approved, new aligners will be sent to the practice, which should then guide the teeth to the desired end result. This is of course time consuming and therefore less desirable. Resolve crowding by Choosing an Approach to Address Crowding You have several options to address crowding in this case: IPR, proclination, or extraction (Fig 7d-8). Expansion and Proclination When considering expansion and proclination as treatment options, it is crucial to assess their appropriateness for the patient's specific dental condition. These are among the most frequently employed movements to correct dental crowding. However, determining whether the necessary amount of expansion and/or proclination is suitable requires a careful evaluation of clinical photographs, taking into account the patient's unique dental anatomy and presentation. Factors to Consider When Proclining Anterior Teeth Before proclining the anterior teeth, evaluate the biotype using clinical photographs. If the root contour is visible in the mandibular anterior region, this suggests a thin gingival and bone biotype. A thin biotype increases the risk of recession when proclining the teeth or performing buccal/labial movements, as these actions may push the roots beyond the bone's boundaries, jeopardising tooth stability and periodontal health. It is also advisable to be cautious of, and potentially avoid, planned \"round tripping,\" a movement protocol that significantly raises the risk of recession. Round Tripping Round tripping is a process in clear aligner treatments where teeth are temporarily moved out of their original positions to facilitate quick and easy IPR. After IPR is performed, the teeth are repositioned to achieve the final desired alignment. This approach often involves initially pushing the teeth beyond their final target positions and subsequently pulling them back to create a more ideal alignment and occlusion. Risks and Implications Movements that push teeth beyond the bone envelope can result in bone loss, particularly when teeth are moved too far buccally or lingually. This bone loss is often accompanied by gingival recession, as the gum tissue follows the receding bone. While round tripping may be necessary in some cases to achieve specific treatment objectives, it 181 Fig 7d-8 resolve crowding by 7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - SPARKcarries significant risks, particularly the risk of inducing gingival recession. Therefore, it should be carefully considered before being included in a treatment plan. Considerations for Dental Arch Expansion Expanding the dental arches typically involves a buccal translation of the posterior teeth. Planning such movements necessitates assessing the potential risk of inducing recessions. This risk arises when the teeth are pushed beyond the confines of the bone during expansion. Factors to consider include: •Biotype: Evaluate the thickness of the gingiva and bone (biotype) to determine the likelihood of recession development. Thin biotypes are associated with an increased risk of recession formation during expansion. •Existing recessions: Take into account any pre-existing recessions, as these indicate vulnerability to further recession development with excessive expansion. •Degree of expansion: Exercise caution to avoid excessive expansion, particularly in cases of thin biotype or existing recessions, to mitigate the risk of recession formation. By carefully considering these factors, it is possible to plan and execute dental arch expansion procedures while minimising the risk of recession development and optimising treatment outcomes. It is important to note that aligner technicians do not take biological limits into account when planning tooth movements. Factors such as bone structure, soft tissue health, the patient’s facial profile, and other anatomical considerations are typically not factored into their planning. As a result, technicians may create end positions and movements based solely on their protocols, which can sometimes lead to undesirable outcomes that should be avoided. For crossbite correction, anterior and posterior crossbites should be corrected by buccal/lingual movements of the crossbite and retraction/contraction in the opposite arch. However, planned posterior crossbite correction beyond 2mm may be unpredictable. If more complex movements are being planned, such as the translation of molars and premolars, it is worth spending extra time to plan these movements carefully. If the teeth do not track during treatment, there is a risk that a simpler, uncontrolled tipping movement may occur instead. Uncontrolled tipping movements can induce an open bite in treatments involving arch expansion. This occurs because the palatal cusp tips move in a coronal direction when a maxillary tooth is tipped buccally, resulting in a “hanging cusp.” This risk and its management are not necessarily included in the technician's protocol. Extractions If it is determined before starting treatment that certain teeth will be extracted, it is crucial to mark them accordingly.",

When using composite material, it is important to leave space around the neighbouring teeth to allow them to move freely, rather than being immobilised by the composite pontic. This approach ensures optimal tooth movement and alignment throughout the treatment. Resolve spacing by When treating patients with spacing issues, there are various options to consider. The choice of treatment should be tailored to what best suits each patient (Fig 7d-9). It's important to remember that teeth naturally position themselves within a space where muscle forces and soft tissues create an equilibrium. Closing all spaces through retraction carries the obvious risk of negatively affecting the patient’s soft tissue profile. Retaining the teeth in this retracted position can be challenging, and even using a bonded retainer in combination with an aligner may not be sufficient. This significantly increases the risk of relapse. Additionally, retracting all the anterior teeth can reduce the space available for the tongue, potentially restricting the airways. This restriction could induce an airway disorder, which may lead to broader health issues. If there are specific spaces between the teeth that need to be maintained, it is important to specify this in the treatment goals. Tip: When there are multiple diastemas in the anterior part of the dental arch, and space redistribution is preferred for minimally invasive restorative closure after orthodontic treatment, it is advisable to provide specific instructions. Clearly indicate the amount of space needed around each tooth. While orthodontic closure of diastemas is often possible, maintaining the closure can be difficult regardless of the retention method used. There is also a risk of inducing a breathing disorder due to potential airway restriction. Therefore, most adult patients with multiple diastemas may benefit more from an ortho-restorative approach. Digital smile design (DSD) can enhance communication with patients and aid in visualising orthodontic tooth positioning before planned restorative procedures, leading to a more comprehensive treatment plan. However, the DSD protocol has a relatively steep learning curve. Anterior-Posterior (A-P) relationship Evaluating both the molar and canine relationships is crucial, particularly in cases with Class II or Class III deviations, as anchorage considerations become significant during treatment. 183\nFig 7d-9 resolve spacing by\n7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - SPARK\nQuestions to consider: •Is the condition being maintained or corrected? •If corrected, is it only the canine relationship or both the canine and molar relationships that are addressed? (Fig 7d-10). If auxiliaries are required, determine if cutouts for elastics are necessary. If so, ensure to tick the appropriate box and follow the protocol outlined in your clinical preferences. When addressing the molar relationship, consider the overall clinical scenario. Achieving a Class I relationship in adult patients with Class II or Class III malocclusions can be challenging and may be unrealistic without surgical intervention. If the molar relationships are not initially Class I but the occlusion is stable, altering the molar relationship may not be necessary, especially in adult patients, to avoid over-treatment. However, if the patient’s profile suggests that modifying the molar relationship to Class I is beneficial, or if the overjet is significant enough to warrant such changes, instruct Spark technicians to optimise or improve the molar relationship accordingly. Class II molar relationships are commonly corrected through techniques such as distalisation of maxillary teeth. Class III molar relationships are most often corrected using Interproximal Reduction (IPR). If excessive IPR is required to achieve a satisfactory occlusion, surgery may be the best treatment option. This approach is preferable to extracting premolars, which can restrict space for the tongue, increase the risk of airway problems, and involve challenging tooth movements to close the extraction sites. (Please remember that tooth movements may appear straightforward in the digital setup, but the reality in the patient’s mouth can be entirely different). Distalisation The responsibility for treatment planning, including the decision to perform distalisation, lies with the treating doctor and not the clear aligner technicians. As the overseeing clinician, you should have the expertise to determine when distalisation is appropriate and when it is not. Distalisation involves bodily movements of the teeth to shift them distally. It's crucial to assess whether such movements can be achieved predictably. When planning distalisation, understanding the predictability of the desired movements is paramount. In the maxilla, distalising movements are generally more predictable due to the nature of the bone. The soft trabecular bone in the maxilla facilitates distalisation, enhancing the predictability of treatment outcomes. Therefore, with careful planning, achieving distalisation in the maxilla is feasible. Planned distalisation in the maxilla invariably demands ample anchorage. However, this anchorage requirement isn't specified by the technicians or indicated in the software. Consequently, the software may suggest smooth movements throughout treatment without   184\nFig 7d-10 Anterior-Posterior (A-P) Relationship\n7. THE PRESCRIPTION FORM/ SUBMITTING A CASE - SPARKacknowledging the need for anchorage. This underscores the importance of the treating doctor thoroughly diagnosing the patient, devising a clear t r e a t m e n t p l a n , a n d c o m p r e h e n s i v e l y understanding the forces necessary to achieve the desired outcome. During treatment planning and the meticulous analysis and optimisation of the digital setup, it's imperative to ensure that the intended movements are attained while preventing unintended ones. This involves deciding on the method of anchorage, whether through elastics attached to teeth (identifying which teeth to involve, when to implement them, for how long, and the rationale behind their use) or through TADs (Temporary Anchorage Devices ie. Mini implants). Distalising or mesialising teeth in the mandible poses greater challenges compared to the maxilla. The mandibular bone is denser, and the root morphology impedes movements in mesial or distal directions. Patients requiring such movements, including root translations, necessitate special precautions and auxiliary support. Improving the canine relation is typically more straightforward. It often involves IPR between the premolars, which usually yields a reasonable enhancement of the canine relation with a relatively straightforward treatment approach. Midline  Consider whether the midline should be maintained or corrected. Providing this information increases the likelihood that the setup will closely match the desired treatment goal (Fig 7d-11). Midline improvements Improving the midline is possible to some extent. There are 3 midline options (Fig 7d-11) :  1.Match upper midline to lower 2.Match lower midline to upper  3.Choose to move each midline a specific amount. The choice should be made based on the initial diagnosis of the patient in combination with your treatment objectives.

Define if both arches or only one arch is to be corrected (Fig 7d-13). Be aware that intrusions and extrusions beyond 2-3 millimetres are unpredictable and usually take a lot of time to achieve with clear aligners. In cases with a need for more than 3 millimetres of extrusion or intrusion, it may be wiser to use fixed appliances as these will be able to perform the wanted movements in a very short time. Compared to clear aligners. Open bite:  In such instances, identifying the etiology of the open bite is crucial. (Developmental, allergies, habits, former orthodontic treatment, TMD, etc.) Tongue habits are always an issue when dealing with open bites and should be diagnosed and sometimes treated elsewhere prior to orthodontic treatment planning. In addition, inducing an airway restriction with orthodontic closure can be a risk. Worsening TMD is also a possible risk factor. Now you can fill in the way you want to correct the open bite (Fig 7d-14). Which teeth would you like to extrude and which do you want to intrude?

Completing this part requires a well-developed treatment plan prior to filling out the prescription form. Additionally, it is essential to understand what can and cannot be achieved with clear aligners. Without a treatment plan and a solid understanding of clear aligner therapy, accurately completing this section can be very challenging. Movement limitations One of the great advantages of the Spark system is that it imposes no movement limitations. However, this flexibility also presents a challenge: while the aligner system allows technicians and you to achieve virtually any desired digital setup, it also increases the likelihood of planning unrealistic or biologically harmful movements. In this section, you can communicate messages to the technicians regarding the preferred end results of the treatment setup. Tip for Effective Instruction: •Use Bullet Points:  Provide short, direct instructions for clarity. •Be Specific:  Clearly define the desired movements to ensure precise implementation. •Select a Reference Tooth:  Choose a specific tooth for alignment instructions to maintain consistency. •Avoid General Terms:  U s e p r e c i s e l a n g u a g e t o p r e v e n t misinterpretation. For example, instead of \"align the teeth,\" specify exact movements or positions. Providing clear and specific instructions helps technicians understand and achieve the desired treatment outcomes accurately. Note: Aligner technicians follow the instructions you provide. If instructions are unclear or too broad, technicians will create a digital setup based on their interpretation of terms like “align the teeth better….” They do not account for biological, aesthetic, or functional considerations unless explicitly instructed.

TREATMENT PREFERENCESTREATMENT PREFERENCES Treatment Preferences Overview •Definition: Treatment preferences are your predefined settings used by aligner technicians from your chosen clear aligner system to plan your cases. •Purpose: These preferences standardise your digital treatment planning protocol to align with your preferences and ensure consistency across all cases. •Access: You can access and manage your treatment preferences through the doctor portal. Note that different aligner brands may have varying locations and slightly different approaches for managing these preferences. •Overrides: Although treatment preferences provide a foundational framework, they can be overridden: -By specific instructions in the prescription form. -By any adjustments made in the digital setup within the planning software, which will take precedence over both the treatment preferences and prescription instructions. The following section outlines the factors that can be defined in your individual treatment preferences and the related considerations. These preferences are standardised and form the basis for the aligner technicians' protocols, ensuring consistency in the planning process. However, they can also be customised to align with your specific treatment goals and clinical needs. By clearly defining these preferences, you help ensure that treatment planning adheres to your protocols and maintains consistency across all cases. It is important to understand that no set of treatment preferences can meet the needs of all patients. Therefore, these preferences should be selected based on your preferred treatment planning workflow, occlusal philosophy, and the method you find most straightforward for editing a digital setup into a realistic and predictable virtual treatment plan. Movement Velocity The most biologically optimal and reliable method of tooth movements involves the application of gentle, continuous forces. Typically, the average rate of orthodontic tooth movement is approximately 1 mm per month per tooth, although this may vary depending on individual biological factors. Taking into consideration the effectiveness of reducing forces/pressure to achieve more predictable tooth movements, it's possible to adjust the treatment approach accordingly. By increasing the number of aligners and thereby reducing the movement velocity, forces applied to the teeth can be decreased while maintaining a consistent, gentle force throughout the treatment process. When movement sequences are carefully planned, this results in more predictable tooth movements, subsequently reducing the likelihood of requiring refinements (additional aligners). 192 8. TREATMENT PREFERENCESHere is an example of a default protocol and two other options offered by the aligner company: Default: Standard movement per tooth, per step – 0.3 mm translation, intrusion, and extrusion. 3 degrees rotation. Option 2 Reduced movement per tooth, per step (will result in increased # of aligners) - 0.2 mm translation, intrusion, and extrusion. 2 degrees rotation. Option 3 Use custom instructions. Here you have to write additional notes for your movement velocity preferences. Wear Schedule The selection of wear schedule should be based on an assessment of the complexity of the tooth movements outlined in the virtual treatment plan, as well as the planned movement velocity. It's important to note that changing the wear schedule does not impact the creation of the digital setup. The wear schedule submitted primarily influences the production logistics of the aligners and is independent of the treatment planning process. IPR Timing There are numerous factors to consider when contemplating IPR and its timing. Beginning with the morphology of the teeth and the accessibility of the interproximal spaces, it's advantageous to conduct IPR when the teeth are aligned and the interproximal contacts are easily reachable. This scenario allows for optimal visualisation of the teeth's morphology and facilitates precise control over the amount of IPR performed. However, a drawback of aligning the teeth before IPR is the necessity to procline, rotate, and expand the teeth into a position close to the desired end position with adequate interproximal contact points. Following this strategy. After IPR is carried out, the teeth are retracted into the desired end position to close the spaces created by this procedure, a process known as round tripping. In patients with thin biotypes or those requiring major movements, round-tripping increases the risk of teeth moving out of the bone, potentially leading to recessions. The recessions may not appear clinically immediately, sometimes they first appear several years after the clear aligner treatment has ended. As a general guideline, we do not recommend conducting IPR in the initial stages of treatment due to several reasons. Firstly, there is a risk of removing enamel before confirming the patient's acceptance of wearing aligners. Postponing IPR until stage three mitigates this risk. Additionally, performing IPR before the teeth become mobile during orthodontic treatment can be challenging. Moreover, teeth may not always be ideally positioned for IPR at stage one. However, with careful planning, the total chair time can be minimised while ensuring the timing of IPR is more optimal, without risking moving teeth out of the bone. This approach also enhances the patient experience when receiving the first set of aligners. 193 8. TREATMENT PREFERENCESEnamel thickness Studies on the thickness of the enamel found that 1mandibular incisors have a thickness of enamel of around 0.3 mm. (Which adds up to 0.6 mm. of enamel in total aproximally in the mandibular front) When incorporating IPR into treatment planning, it's crucial to exercise caution to ensure that the procedure remains within the enamel boundaries of each tooth. Therefore, every tooth earmarked for IPR requires careful inspection in photographs and in the digital setup to verify that the planned amount of IPR remains within the enamel. Additionally, consideration must be given to the morphology of the teeth. For instance, a tooth with a triangular morphology may result in the formation of a noticeable black triangle after alignment. In such cases, it may be advisable to plan IPR, provided it aligns with the treatment plan's complexity and the enamel thickness of the tooth in question. Teeth with fillings in approximal areas may also present opportunities for increased IPR. However, the decision should be contingent upon the tooth's morphology and the overall treatment plan. Anterior Torque Dr. Larry Andrews' third key (Fig 4-46) pertains to the inclination of the front teeth. The preference for having anterior occlusal contacts in maximum intercuspation varies among dentists. Furthermore, it is influenced by the type of treatment being conducted and the feasibility of achieving anterior occlusal contacts or anterior coupling in a given case. Posterior Torque Strategically planning a lingual inclination for mandibular molars and premolars contributes to achieving the desired curve of Wilson, characterised by a subtle concave contour in the mandible and a slight convex shape in the maxilla. This configuration optimises occlusal dynamics, promoting efficient masticatory function and stability. The curve of Wilson, an essential consideration in functional occlusion, pertains to the bucco-lingual inclination of posterior teeth. It holds significant importance in determining the optimal positioning of occlusal surfaces in various occlusal philosophies. When combined with effective canine guidance, the curve of Wilson (Fig 8-1), facilitates the attainment of immediate posterior disclusion, enhancing overall occlusal function.",

Option 2: Upright upper posterior teeth and apply slight negative torque on lower posteriors. Option 3: Upright lower posterior teeth and apply slight positive torque on upper posteriors. Expansion Before proceeding with expansion and proclination planning, the estimated bone volume and gingival thickness should be evaluated to ensure adequate hard and soft tissue support for the planned procedures. By understanding the principles of the described forces, the desired expansion and proclination can be strategically staged to maintain sufficient anchorage, thus ensuring successful clinical outcomes for the intended movements. While bone around teeth can undergo changes during movement, the cortical surface typically remains unchanged. If a root is shifted beyond the cortical bone, it may not automatically be re-covered by bone upon returning within the original cortical bone frame. As a result, expansions necessitate careful monitoring of facial changes throughout the planned treatment stages to ensure desired outcomes are achieved. With this in mind. It is not always easy to predefine a standard for all cases. Here are some examples of options offered as treatment preferences: Default: Expansion of canines to 1st molars combined with anterior protrusion. No expansion in 2nd & 3rd molars. Maximum 2 mm per quadrant. Option 2: Expansion of canines to premolars hold other teeth as anchors. Maximum 3 mm per quadrant. Option 3: Use custom instructions Class II Corrections In growing patients, such as children, achieving mandibular advancement in Class II cases can be possible through the use of Class II elastics and other mandibular advancement techniques. This advancement occurs due to two primary factors: •Growth adaptation: The joints and bone adapt to orthodontically induced forces, allowing for up to an estimated 20% alteration in growth. This adaptation enables the mandible to advance in response to orthodontic treatment. •Habitual adaptation: Children adapt musculature and habits to fit their occlusal patterns, adjusting their bite automatically to achieve the best fit between the maxillary and mandibular teeth. In the clear aligner software, this adaptation is demonstrated through simulations such as the Arch Correction or a \"bite jump.” However, in adult patients, achieving a bite jump typically requires maxillofacial surgery. We generally recommend disabling the bite jump feature by default. This precaution helps avoid potentially problematic conditions being overlooked, as the software may generate an unrealistic simulation that does not accurately reflect the clinical situation. When treating adult patients with a significant overjet and a profile indicating potential benefit from Class II correction, the most predictable treatment with clear aligners involves sequential 195 8. TREATMENT PREFERENCESdistalisation of the maxillary teeth. If distalisation of more than 1 mm is planned, there is a substantial risk of anchorage loss if Class II elastics or temporary anchorage devices (TADs) combined with elastics are not utilised. Lack of anchorage can cause the molars to move back and forth, making it appear as though no tooth movement has occurred clinically. In class II patients requiring more than 1 millimetre of maxillary retraction, it's crucial",

      "text": "to consider the potential impact on the patient's profile. Monitor changes in soft tissue support, particularly if the anterior teeth are retracted excessively. Over-retraction may cause the lip to droop, potentially obscuring the teeth during smiling. Moreover, excessive retraction can lead to a perceived reclining of the entire lower face, which is seldom beneficial for the patient. Here are some typical standard protocols: Class II div. 1: •Sequential movement with 50% protocol v-pattern Distalising max 4 mm. •Vertical attachments on premolars and 1st molar when translating more than 1 mm •Distal rotate upper 1st molar •Expansion •Use class II elastics Class II div. 2: •Procline - intrude - retract. •Distal rotate upper 1st molar. •50% sequential distalisation protocol •Vertical engagers on premolars and 1st molar when translating more than 1 mm •Use class II elastics Smile Arc Typical default: Follow lip guidance based on the frontal smiling picture Option 2: Align and level following ideal occlusion, no lip guidance. It's crucial to prioritise the treatment's purpose. Patients frequently express aesthetic preferences, which must be carefully considered when planning the final occlusion from a functional standpoint. During the diagnostic phase, conducting an aesthetic dento-labial analysis helps outline the smile arc or smile line in relation to the existing anterior maxillary teeth. This analysis guides how teeth should be aligned to achieve a favourable aesthetic outcome. Whether adhering to the existing smile line or defining a new one, it's essential to collaborate with the patient to determine the preferred approach. The communication with the patient can be enhanced greatly with the aid of digital smile design tools. Tools like these can be found in software like SmileCloud. Occlusion Dentists' preferences on this matter vary considerably. We advocate for a personalised approach to each case, keeping an open mind towards different treatment philosophies and selecting the most suitable form of treatment for each patient. Begin by establishing your preferred treatment philosophy as a baseline and then assess each case individually to determine if the treatment goal is both realistic and predictable within these parameters. Posterior open bites can sometimes develop during treatment due to occlusal interferences in the anterior region. In such cases, primary anterior contacts prevent the mandible from fully closing, resulting in a posterior open bite at the end of treatment. 196 8. TREATMENT PREFERENCESThere are typically three primary reasons for the occurrence of posterior open bites: 1.Anterior auto-rotation of the mandible resulting from occlusal changes. 2.Inadequate intrusion of anterior teeth can create occlusal interferences that result in a posterior open bite. 3.Interproximal reduction (IPR) presents another challenge for practitioners worldwide. During IPR, teeth undergo slight movement, causing them to separate when a measuring device is used. If excessive force is applied to the measuring device, it may appear that the correct amount of enamel reduction has been achieved when, in reality, too little enamel has been removed. Consequently, there is increased contact in the anterior part of the mouth, preventing the mandibular anterior teeth from being retracted as much as planned in the software, resulting in a posterior open bite. In such instances, determining where to perform IPR to address the issue becomes challenging, as there is no reliable method to approximate the amount of enamel remaining. These challenges underscore the need for a more predictable IPR solution, preferably a machine-driven system with calibrated diamond-covered polishing tips. This should all be considered when you set your preferences in your aligner software. Consider whether you want a general standard (Like no anterior contacts) or if you prefer to define it from case to case.",

      "text": "Curve of Spee (COS) A pronounced curve of Spee often correlates with a significant overjet and/or deep bite. When addressing the curve of Spee, it's crucial to assess anchorage on premolars and molars, especially when substantial intrusion (more than 2-3 millimetres) is required. In such cases, horizontal attachments or engagers on premolars or molars may be necessary. These attachments primarily serve to prevent aligners from detaching from the teeth, as the forces intended to intrude the anterior segment will also exert a counteracting force, pushing the aligner in a coronal direction in the posterior segment (Newtons 3rd law). The orthodontic standard is usually a flat curve of Spee achieved by a combination of tipping, intrusion, and extrusion. Virtual C-chain Virtual C-chain stages are planned at the end of the treatment. A virtual C-chain usually consists of two extra stages being added to the virtual treatment plan. The stages are adding lingual translation from canine to canine to tighten approximal contacts. This is sometimes necessary if a lot of IPR has been performed during treatment, as this sometimes increases the risk of residual spacing. The C-chain stages are only needed if tightening of the approximal contacts is needed. If it is not needed and the aligners are being used anyway there is a risk that the c-chain aligners will induce anterior crowding. Usually the c-chain stages have to be requested on prescription. However, some aligner companies allow you to add these as a standard feature. Should you prefer this. First Molars The necessity of moving the first molar varies from case to case. While treatment is generally simplified if molars remain stationary, not moving them may fall short of meeting orthodontic golden standards. Furthermore, retaining the first molars 197 8. TREATMENT PREFERENCESin their original position may lead to excessive IPR in the anterior region, as indicated by Dr. Larry Andrews' fourth key (Fig 4-46). Therefore, it's crucial to determine whether treatment might be compromised due to uncertainty regarding the treating doctor's ability to address molar movement. Second & Third Molars The necessity of moving second molars varies depending on the individual case. While treatment is simplified if the molars require no movement, it's important to consider whether treatment might be compromised due to uncertainty about handling the posterior molars. Tip: At times, extraction of a third molar may be necessary before or during orthodontic treatment. When planning such an extraction, it can be beneficial to coordinate it with a stage in the treatment where the second molar is being moved. This is because the bone remodelling in the extraction socket facilitates movements in the distal part of the second molar, making the process smoother and more efficient. Overjet & Overbite Typical default: Set to ideal overjet (2 +/- 0.5 mm) with no anterior contacts. Option 2: Set overjet to (2 – 3 mm) but with slight overbite and light anterior contacts. As illustrated. The software allows both a standard protocol leaving either a big overjet or almost no overjet with occlusal contact in the front at the end of treatment. Whether the one or the other option is chosen is up to the treating doctor. The choice of a standard protocol is usually dictated by the philosophy of the doctor. Some doctors always want stabile contact in the anterior region while others prefer more room for long term settling movements. In general the choice in part will often depend on the inclination of the teeth, and how deep the bite is. A correction of an overjet requires awareness of the relationship between the maxillary and the mandibular anteriors and the inclination of the anterior teeth. (Dr. Larry Andrews third key (Fig 4-45)). The development of a stable and reliable function requires proper management of the canine and anterior guidance. A well planned and adapted envelope of function will minimise the risk of tooth wear and fractures of restorations in general. Mild-Moderate Crowding Default example: Expand canines & premolar regions, place IPR as needed, and apply anterior protrusion. Option 2 example: Expand canines, premolar regions, and first molars. Place IPR as needed, but no anterior protrusion. While having a standard approach is beneficial, it's essential to diagnose and evaluate each case individually. The treating doctor must determine the optimal treatment for each patient, taking into account factors such as tooth shape and the patient's biotype. In making these decisions, it's important to apply a philosophy that integrates both static and functional occlusion. This involves considering not only how the teeth come together when the jaw is closed at rest (static occlusion) but also how they 198 8. TREATMENT PREFERENCESfunction during activities like chewing and speaking (functional occlusion). By incorporating both aspects, the treating doctor can create a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses the patient's unique needs and optimises treatment outcomes. Moderate-Severe Crowding While having a standard approach can provide a simplified initial strategy, for the aligner technicians creating the initial digital setup, it's crucial to evaluate each case individually to determine the most suitable treatment for the patient. Factors such as the shape of the teeth and the patient's biotype play a significant role in this evaluation. For patients with a thin biotype, it's important to be cautious of “round-tripping”. This involves proclining the teeth to facilitate IPR, and then retracting them afterwards. In patients with a thin biotype, round-tripping poses a significant risk of creating recessions over time, as once the roots are moved out of the bone, bone loss occurs. The cortical bone covering the surface of the root may never return once a tooth has been moved out of the bone. Recessions may not immediately manifest but can appear years after treatment. It's worth noting that recessions can also occur in posterior segments. Therefore, careful examination of the digital setup and staging of movements before approval is crucial. Staging IPR involves planning the procedure in different stages, where two or more teeth are positioned to allow for precise and easy IPR. After IPR, the teeth can be realigned to create space for the next set of teeth. While this approach may be slower than round-tripping, it reduces the risk of recessions. Ultimately, this careful staging approach balances treatment efficiency with the preservation of dental health in the long term. Attachment/Engager Protocols When attachments are not used or are removed, clear aligners may struggle to maintain a firm grip on the teeth, making it difficult to achieve the desired movements. Depending on the planned movements, without attachments, the risk of tracking issues increases significantly. Various opinions and protocols exist regarding the placement and timing of attachments. It's important to recognise that protocols should adapt according to the aligner's design. For instance, an aligner system with a straight trimline may require a different protocol than one with a scalloped trimline.",

For instance, an aligner system with a straight trimline may require a different protocol than one with a scalloped trimline.\n\nIn addition, the placement of the individual attachment/engager depends on the type of movement that is to be achieved. There are various designs of engagers and attachments, and most clear aligner companies continually try to develop new and improved versions. However, the standard horizontal and vertical designs, despite their simplicity, are just as effective as more complex options. The straightforward design also simplifies the selection process, making it easier to choose the best fit for a specific movement. As a general guideline, teeth requiring rotation should be equipped with vertical engagers, while controlled root movements such as translations and controlled mesial/distal tipping also necessitate vertical engagers. It is also worth thinking about horizontal and vertical engagers in regard to anchorage of the aligner during treatment due to Newton's third law of motion stating that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 199\n8. TREATMENT PREFERENCESThere's no universal protocol suitable for all cases. The choice of engager depends largely on tooth morphology and the intended movements. Additionally, when multiple tooth movements are planned, aligner technicians may need to prioritise which type of engager to use and which to remove. However, this decision may require correction by the treating doctor. In some instances, selecting the right engager form and position from the start is sufficient. In others, staging must be planned where one type of engager is replaced by another as treatment progresses and different types of movements are required. Attachment/Engager Timing Clinical tips: When selecting this preference, think about the workflow in your practice. 1.It is worth considering the entire patient experience as patient compliance may very well be affected by the patient's initial experience of treatment. In addition, a positive patient experience will increase the probability of patients spreading a positive story about your dental practice. Which in turn will strengthen the practice brand. 2.For a patient starting a clear aligner treatment. It is without a doubt a lot easier to place and remove the aligners if no attachments have been bonded to the teeth. Making this part easier for the patient will automatically reduce the chair time spent instructing the patient on the use of the aligners. Which again will lead to a more positive patient experience. 3.When delivering the first set of aligners, there is no basis for knowing the future compliance of the patient in regards to the use of their clear aligners. If the patient shows up 3 weeks into treatment with a desire to discontinue treatment, it requires precious chair time to remove attachments that, at this point in the treatment, have never really had a function. (The teeth do not start moving until 4 weeks into treatment) 4.By placing attachments at stage 3, the patients have already adjusted to using their aligners by the time attachments are being bonded to the teeth. This familiarity often results in patients adapting more easily to attachments, reducing the need for extensive instruction and chair time. Consequently, patients tend to perceive the treatment process more positively. Attachment/Engager Size The size needed is individual in each case depending on the shape of the clinical crown and the amount of movement that the tooth needs to go through during treatment. The size of an attachment plays a significant role in its reliability to function as intended. In general larger attachments provide greater retention and stability compared to smaller ones. Larger attachments offer an increased surface area for adhesion to the tooth surface, resulting in improved grip and resistance to dislodgement during aligner wear. Additionally, the size of the attachment influences the distribution of forces exerted by the aligner. Larger attachments distribute forces more evenly across the tooth surface, promoting more predictable tooth movement and reducing the risk of undesirable tracking issues. However, it's important to strike a balance between attachment size and patient comfort. 200",

TREATMENT PREFERENCESWhile larger attachments may offer superior retention, they can also cause discomfort or irritation for the patient, especially if they impinge on soft tissues or interfere with speech. In addition, thick attachments may result in difficulties in placing and removing the aligner easily.  Overall, while larger attachments generally provide greater reliability in functioning as intended, the optimal attachment size should be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as tooth morphology, treatment goals, and patient comfort.  Bite ramps (Fig 8-2) Bite ramps, sometimes referred to as “bite turbos”, serve to dis-occlude the bite in cases of deep bite, facilitating posterior extrusion more effectively. Furthermore, they can aid in neutralising a crossbite.  By default some aligner companies allow standards like how many bite ramps should be placed, where and in which situations.  Before incorporating bite ramps, it is prudent to confirm that the overjet is not excessively large, as bite ramps have size limitations. Additionally, ensure that the mandibular teeth will indeed make contact with the bite ramps. It's essential to note that bite ramps are a built-in feature of aligners and should not be bonded to the teeth. Be aware of the size of the bite ramps if you plan to procline the mandibular front teeth or retract the maxillary anteriors, as the bite ramps may interfere with these movements. Additionally, bite ramps can function like a deprogrammer, allowing the mandible to seat into centric relation (CR). If this occurs unintentionally, it may alter the entire treatment plan and the realistic treatment outcome. Cutout Shapes (Fig 8-3) Cutouts should always be chosen with consideration to all the anchorage needed in both arches. This means the timing of cutouts and the staging of the treatment should be analysed and adapted. Anchorage with buttons, TADs and elastics increases the complexity of the treatment and thereby the potential need for revisions (additional aligners).  For instance, sometimes it is an advantage to place a button on a tooth rather than making slits or hooks in the aligners. Sometimes the cutout should be made on a premolar rather than on a molar or canine. It all depends on the planned movements and the timing of the movements (Staging).  TIP: When incorporating cutouts, hooks or slits in the aligner design, it's crucial to consider aligner retention. For example, when patients use class II elastics, these elastics exert a downward force on the maxillary aligner. Without the addition of engagers to the teeth, there's a significant risk of the aligner becoming dislodged during elastic use. Such dislocation can disrupt all planned movements throughout the aligner, affecting treatment outcomes.

Missing/Extracted Tooth When a tooth is missing, there are aligner companies, that offer different options:  •No tooth (The aligner will follow the shape of the soft tissue) •Bar design •Pontic design. It can be challenging to have a bar on the posterior part of the arch.  1.In the virtual treatment plan, it is often difficult to tell the difference between the soft tissue and the planned bar design. In the virtual treatment plan, it looks like the height of the gingiva has changed. 2.Patients often find it uncomfortable to use a clear aligner with a bar as opposed to a pontic due to the presence of sharp edges that can irritate the gingiva. In the digital setup, pontics are often simulated as normal teeth but with a contrasting colour.  In the aesthetic zone, aligner pontics can be shaded with tooth-coloured material to simulate the appearance of a natural tooth while the patient wears the aligner. Composite or provisional tooth-coloured materials are commonly used, with care taken to ensure that the material does not extend too close to neighbouring teeth, thereby avoiding interference with tooth movement. Erupting Teeth It's crucial to understand that when treating patients with erupting teeth, we mustn't impede the natural eruption process. Consequently, there should be space allocated in the aligner to accommodate the eruption of the teeth into their intended or planned positions. If we aim for a more active eruption where the aligner applies force to guide the tooth, it's essential that a portion of the tooth has already erupted, allowing   202\nFig 8-3 Cutout",

SPACE DISTRIBUTIONSPACE DISTRIBUTION Patients desiring a beautiful smile, often have misaligned teeth. Often it is represented as either crowding or spacing. The most common patient complaint is about crowding of the anterior segment. In this chapter, we will discuss how to treat the misalignment of teeth. Digital Perfection vs. Real-World Risks As one of our customers - let’s call her Dr. Annie - sat down to review the digital setup for her next clear aligner patient, she couldn't shake the feeling of unease. The simulation on her screen looked flawless: perfectly aligned teeth, a beautiful arch, and a smile that would light up any room. Yet, something was off. She had seen this before - cases where the digital perfection did not translate into real-world success. Recalling a particularly harrowing incident where a patient nearly lost their front teeth due to excessive recession caused by such digital errors, Annie knew she had to scrutinise every detail. In that past case, the aligner technicians had moved the anterior teeth several millimetres without considering the biological limitations of the bone or the patient's profile. The patient's teeth were indeed straight, but the aftermath was devastating—severe gum recession, compromised teeth stability, and a struggling airway. It was a classic example of \"cartoon dentistry,\" where everything works perfectly on the screen but falls apart in reality. Annie sighed, realising the same mistakes were happening far too often. Time constraints and the allure of an impressively perfect digital simulation often led to critical errors being overlooked. She knew she had to act meticulously, double-checking the aligner plans against the patient's anatomical realities. The stakes were too high; a beautiful smile could not come at the cost of the patient's dental health or overall well-being. Which was why she contacted us. Crowding Depending on the severity of the crowding (Fig 4-23), there are different approaches. Before even looking at possible treatments for crowding a comprehensive orthodontic assessment should form the basis for any decision r e g a r d i n g t r e a t m e n t . E v e n s e e m i n g l y straightforward cases can reveal complexities upon thorough diagnosis analysis, and conversely, cases that initially appear complex may turn out to be simpler than expected. If the case only involves mild to moderate crowding it can often be resolved with expansion, proclination or IPR. Often there will be a need for a combination of all three. It depends on other clinical situations such as biotype, the size and shape of the teeth, as well as the profile of the patient. Having a clear plan and understanding of the treatment approach, along with determining the necessary steps beforehand, significantly impacts the outcome in terms of realism, biological safety, and predictability. This preparation is evident in the time invested during clinical treatment and directly influences the quality of the final treatment result. 206 9. SPACE DISTRIBUTION In cases of severe crowding in Class II malocclusions where conventional treatment approaches are insufficient, distalisation of the maxillary molars and premolars may be considered. The 50% sequential distalisation protocol (As also described in the chapter “Sagittal discrepancies”) has proven to be the most reliable method for achieving distalisation with clear aligners. When using class II elastics. If third molars are present, they should be extracted at stage 3, followed immediately by the initiation of distalisation of the second molar. Bone remodelling in the extraction site facilitates the movement of the second molar. Once the second molar has progressed halfway to its final position, the movement of the first molar can begin. Progressing sequentially, once the second molar reaches its end position, the second premolar starts moving, followed by the first premolar when the first molar ceases movement. This sequential process continues until the canine reaches its final position, leaving sufficient space to resolve the crowding in the maxillary arch. TIP: It's important to inform the patient that once a tooth is extracted, reinserting the aligner will likely cause it to fill with blood quickly. Preparing the patient for this in advance helps manage expectations. On the day of extraction, advise the patient to wait until they are home before reinserting the aligner to avoid any uncomfortable situations in public. We would typically insert a collagen cone into the extraction site and cover it with a relatively big piece of gauze and let the patient bite on this for at least 20 minutes while returning home. The next day the blood clot formation has taken place and the patient will most likely not have any problems as the aligner will help protecting the extraction site. Force distribution If proclination of the maxillary front teeth is required, it can be initiated concurrently with the start of distalising movement of the first molar. This is because the force exerted on the posterior teeth generates an equal and opposite force directed toward the anterior teeth. This ensures that forces in both directions are distributed to achieve desired movements. When the second premolar begins its distalising movement, Class II elastics should be employed, as the anterior segment may not provide adequate anchorage. However, it's crucial to connect the Class II elastics to a button rather than slits or a hook on the canines. Using slits/hooks will create downward and distal forces distributed to the anterior teeth, counteracting the desired proclination. This example highlights the importance of calculating all forces involved in moving teeth within the context of the entire treatment plan for the patient. Ideally, forces should be distributed to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes, or at the very least, opposing forces should be directed to sufficient anchorage points/areas to minimise their impact on the final result. 207 Fig 4-23 severe crowding 9. SPACE DISTRIBUTIONDuring sequential distalisation in the maxillary arch, ensuring sufficient anchorage is paramount for successful tooth movement. While class II elastics are commonly utilised for this purpose, employing TADs can provide even greater anchorage. TADs can be strategically positioned in the maxilla, optimising the position of the elastic in relation to the centre of resistance when moving maxillary teeth posteriorly. This enhanced anchorage provided by TADs contributes to more effective and predictable tooth movement during sequential distalisation. Distalisation in the mandible is very unpredictable, due to the compact bone, as well as the root morphology of the molars. As a consequence, distalisation of the mandibular teeth should be avoided. Extractions In cases with severe crowding, extractions may be considered as a treatment option. The extraction of the first maxillary premolar or, in cases of severe mandibular crowding, an incisor extraction are common choices. When dealing with extraction cases, maintaining appropriate anchorage and carefully considering its placement are crucial factors. It's important to assess the amount of space needed and the space gained from the extraction(s) before proceeding with treatment.",

It's important to assess the amount of space needed and the space gained from the extraction(s) before proceeding with treatment.\n\nAdditionally, ensuring the correct tooth movements with the appropriate type of anchorage after the extraction(s) is equally essential. In most aligner systems, two different virtual treatment plans can be created for comparison. This allows for an evaluation of space distribution and the resolution of treatment approaches, providing insight into the predictability of each method while adhering to clinical limitations. In addition to virtual treatment planning, it's imperative to critically evaluate the realism of the proposed plan. While movements may appear straightforward on the computer screen, closing a space after an extraction often results in tipping movements and potential bite collapse, as the centre of rotation and resistance have not been adequately considered. Planning such movements requires careful thought, and relying solely on the virtual plan is not advisable. Typically, several power arms on both sides of the extraction site, connected with elastics, are necessary to achieve the desired outcomes. The difficulty of handling extraction cases should never be underestimated. TIP: Placing power arms is easier when their positions are planned from the start during the virtual treatment planning process. This approach allows you to request cutouts in the precise locations where the power arms will be placed. Spacing Spacing (Fig 4-24) cases typically arise from various factors such as tooth size discrepancies, arch length discrepancies, missing teeth, or increased jaw dimensions. When addressing spacing issues in orthodontics, tooth movements are often not overly complex, especially if the teeth are flaring outwards. However, it is essential to consider the space required for proper tongue function. Teeth naturally position themselves where there is a balance between the pressures exerted by the tongue, cheeks, and lips, an area known as the \"neutral zone.\" Spacing cases often stem from tongue function, where the pressure from the tongue exceeds that of the cheeks and lips, pushing the teeth in an   208\n9. SPACE DISTRIBUTION\nanterior direction, especially during swallowing. This habit of the tongue, if not corrected, can pose challenges in achieving desired tooth movements during aligner treatment and may complicate retention efforts post-treatment. Exclusively orthodontically treated spacing cases carry a heightened risk of relapse. In cases with tooth size discrepancies, it may be beneficial to redistribute the spaces and combine orthodontic treatment with restorative procedures to create teeth of more harmonious size. This approach allows for the repositioning of the teeth within the neutral zone to facilitate minimally invasive restorative interventions. In cases involving increased jaw dimensions and a large tongue, strategic spacing management may involve leaving spaces in areas where creating an optical illusion of a harmonious smile is feasible. For instance, spaces distal to the canines can be managed restoratively with composite or porcelain no-prep veneers, minimising aesthetic concerns. In cases where a tongue habit complicates orthodontic treatment, there is debate on whether to address this issue before or after the orthodontic intervention. Some argue that managing the tongue habit beforehand is crucial for ensuring the long-term stability of the orthodontic results. Conversely, others believe that the tongue needs space to adapt or be trained to achieve a harmonious balance with the surrounding tissues. Space that can only be achieved through orthodontic treatment. When the frenulum is too thick or extends too far down, it can create a physical barrier that prevents the central incisors from coming together. In such cases, performing a frenectomy can help eliminate this barrier and allow the teeth to move together more effectively during orthodontic treatment. After the orthodontic treatment is completed, a frenectomy can also help maintain the stability of the closure by preventing the frenulum from pulling the teeth apart again. Bridging the Gap After a short review of the case presented by Dr. Annie, we found the issues. The anterior teeth were being moved too far forward, risking the very problems Dr. Annie feared. We made the necessary adjustments, ensuring the aligner plan respected the biological boundaries and the patient's profile. Revising the plan, we emphasised the importance of integrating these real-world considerations into the digital setup to create a realistic, safe and predictable virtual treatment plan. Weeks after initiating treatment, Annie’s patient returned for a follow-up. The treatment was progressing smoothly, the teeth were aligning beautifully, and most importantly, the patient's oral health remained uncompromised. Annie shared with us, that she felt a wave of relief wash over her. She had avoided another potential disaster by catching the digital errors early. The patient left with a confident smile, unaware of the near-miss. The chapter closed not just on a successfully treated case, but on a reaffirmed commitment to bridging the gap between digital simulations and   209\nFig 4-24 moderate spacing\n9. SPACE DISTRIBUTIONbiological reality. The tension that had once gripped Annie now transformed into a reassuring certainty: with vigilance and care, the promise of clear aligner treatments could be fully realised without compromise. 210",

VERTICAL DISCREPANCYVERTICAL DISCREPANCY Vertical discrepancies in occlusion are commonly associated with deep bites and anterior open bites. Deep bites, characterised by the overlap of the mandibular incisors by the maxillary incisors, can range from mild to severe and are often challenging to treat effectively with clear aligners. Measurement of a deep overbite can be expressed in millimetres or as a percentage of overlap. Conversely, open bites exhibit no overlap between the maxillary and mandibular incisors. It is worth noting that there is almost always a tongue habit associated with open bites. During the initial orthodontic examination, the lower facial height and its proportion to the entire face are assessed. Subsequently, in the treatment planning phase, the evaluation of extraoral photos helps determine the most suitable treatment approach for the patient. In restorative dentistry, a fundamental principle is to avoid conflicting with the muscles. Interferences between muscles, joints, and teeth typically result in muscle-dominated outcomes, potentially leading to tooth and joint damage. Some occlusal philosophies suggest that the vertical dimension remains stable over time, determined by muscle length, except in cases of multiple posterior tooth loss leading to a collapsed bite. We believe this principle applies to orthodontics as well. Elevating the bite may prompt muscular adaptation over time, potentially causing intrusion post-treatment. Predicting the extent, location, and timing of such changes is challenging. Therefore, it's essential to consider muscular forces and their long-term effects when planning treatments that may impact the vertical dimension. Clinically this may represent a challenge if the final treatment result relies on posterior extrusion to create the desired anterior vertical dimensions. Over time the posterior extrusion may relapse due to the muscular forces, potentially leading to increased forces on the anterior teeth. Whether or not this ends up with a clinically relevant problem for the patient or not is hard to predict. When Digital Orthodontic Planning Goes Wrong - A real life story. Dr. Hughes stared at her computer screen, frustration boiling beneath her calm exterior. She had been treating Sarah, a young woman with a persistent anterior open bite, for several months. The digital setup in her orthodontic software had promised a flawless outcome: the posterior segments would be intruded, and the anterior maxillary teeth would extrude into a harmonious relationship with the mandibular teeth. The virtual model was perfect, a testament to modern dental technology. But reality had a different plan. Dr. Hughes had heard about the unpredictability of bite jumps. Determined to avoid the associated pitfalls, she had opted not to intrude the posterior segments, overlooking the critical need for proper anchorage and the distribution of opposing forces during anterior extrusion. She had meticulously followed the virtual plan, convinced that the digital roadmap was foolproof. 216 10. VERTICAL DISCREPANCYYet, as she neared the end of the treatment, her confidence turned to dread. Sarah’s initial gummy smile had transformed into an even more pronounced one. The patient, once eager to close her open bite, now faced the possibility of orthognathic surgery to correct the unintended consequence of the treatment. The root of the problem? Dr. Hughes had neglected to incorporate extraoral photos into her virtual treatment planning. The beautiful symmetry of the digital model had blinded her to the real-world implications, leaving Sarah with a more significant aesthetic issue than she had started with. The once promising digital solution now seemed like a cruel joke, a reminder of the delicate balance between technology and human judgment. Deep bite Patients with deep bites (Fig 10-1) often present with over-erupted mandibular incisors and a steep curve of Spee, sometimes accompanied by over-eruption of maxillary incisors, potentially resulting in a gummy smile. Correcting a deep bite is challenging and requires careful consideration. One of the most crucial aspects of deep bite correction is ensuring sufficient anchorage. For mandibular incisor intrusion, it's advisable to plan treatment in conjunction with posterior extrusion to maintain a balance between intruding and extruding forces. Retentive engagers/attachments on premolars and possibly molars, depending on the case, are essential to ensure anchorage and aid in levelling the curve of Spee and improving the deep bite. You're correct in pointing out the apparent contradiction regarding planning posterior extrusion. Allow us to clarify. While it's true that posterior extrusion poses challenges due to muscular forces, it's important to recognise that some degree of posterior extrusion naturally occurs during the intrusion of anterior teeth. This inherent posterior extrusion force needs to be considered and factored into the treatment plan. However, achieving significant posterior extrusion, beyond approximately 0.5 millimetres, may be unrealistic due to the opposing muscular forces favouring anterior intrusion. While the initial treatment may result in some posterior extrusion, there's a risk that this extrusion will diminish over time. Therefore, this risk should be taken into account when developing the long-term retention plan. Bear in mind that 0.5 millimetres of posterior extrusion may result in up to a 1.5 millimetre increase in the anterior vertical relation. Similar principles apply to the maxillary arch, but attention must be paid to the patient's smile aesthetics. Intrusion of maxillary incisors should not be excessive to the point of being hidden behind the lip, which could compromise the patient's smile. One of the main challenges in treating deep bites is managing mandibular incisor intrusion, particularly in cases of limited anterior bone space. Additionally, extrusion and intrusion of posterior segments in both arches pose challenges, especially when patients continue to occlude on posterior teeth. Bite ramps can be utilised to prevent posterior occlusion and 217 Fig 10-1 Deep bite 10. VERTICAL DISCREPANCYfacilitate posterior extrusion, although long-term stability may be questionable due to muscular forces. Understanding Deep Bite Correction: Addressing deep bites encompasses various strategies, such as anterior proclination for relative intrusion, absolute anterior intrusion, and posterior segment extrusion, along with the curve of Spee levelling achieved through anterior intrusion and posterior extrusion. It's imperative that the selected treatment plan is tailored to the patient's individual needs, objectives, and anatomical Proclining anterior teeth for relative intrusion: Patients exhibiting notably upright or retroclined anterior teeth alongside crowding may find benefit in proclining these teeth, thereby achieving relative intrusion. This method contributes to enhancing the overbite and establishing more appropriate anterior stops (Fig 10-2). Absolute intrusion for cases with good axial inclinations: When anterior teeth possess favourable axial inclinations or when proclination alone proves insufficient, a strategy of absolute intrusion can be implemented to further diminish the overbite. Tailored to the patient's smile line, this treatment approach may entail intruding the upper, lower, or all anterior teeth to effectively manage the deep bite (Fig 10-3). Extrusion for cases with a reduced vertical dimension: In cases where a patient presents with a reduced vertical dimension and a deep bite, extrusion of the posterior teeth, particularly the premolars, becomes necessary to address the overbite and elevate the vertical dimension. Posterior extrusion induces mandibular rotation, consequently reducing the overbite.",

Posterior extrusion induces mandibular rotation, consequently reducing the overbite.\n\nTypically, 1 mm of posterior extrusion typically results in an approximate decrease in overbite ranging from 2.5 to 3 millimetres (Fig 10-4). Bite ramps When utilising bite ramps in treatment, it's crucial to understand that they are a feature incorporated into the aligners, typically positioned on the palatal surface of the anterior maxillary teeth from canine to canine. Ensuring that the mandibular anterior teeth make contact with the bite ramps during occlusion is essential for their effectiveness. 218\nFig 10-3 Absolute intrusion\nFig 10-2 Relativ intrusion\n10. VERTICAL DISCREPANCYBite ramps can be added to all anterior teeth or selectively to specific ones. However, it's imperative to ensure that the overjet is not excessively large, as this could prevent mandibular anterior teeth from contacting the bite ramps. In cases of significant overjet, the presence of bite ramps may impede the planned movements by filling the space between the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth. Achieving intrusion of mandibular anterior teeth and posterior extrusion as typically shown in the virtual treatment plan, presents challenges due to the nature of these movements. They should be planned simultaneously but will not always be expressed clinically as visualised in the software. While intrusions of around 2 millimetres in the anterior segment of both arches are generally predictable, movements exceeding this threshold, particularly in extrusion, become more uncertain. Correcting a deep bite with posterior extrusion can alter the vertical height of the lower face, albeit with varying success. Changes in vertical height induced during treatment may experience some degree of relapse over time, influenced by natural muscle forces governing bite function. The appearance of heavy occlusal contacts in the virtual treatment plan indicates planned posterior extrusion, although, without a virtual articulator in the software, visualisation of mandibular auto-rotation during vertical dimension reduction relies on imagination. It's worth noting that a one-millimetre change in posterior teeth's vertical height typically corresponds to a three millimetre alteration in the anterior segment, owing to the temporo-mandibular joint's hinge axis movement during mandibular movement. Open bite The anterior open bite represents the converse condition of a deep bite (Fig 10-5). Typically, treating an anterior open bite necessitates anterior extrusions and posterior intrusions, varying based on the severity of the condition. While deep bites often have genetic and growth-related origins, the same holds true for anterior open bites. However, the latter often involves dysfunctional tongue habits, as closing the anterior tooth gap during swallowing is impossible without the involvement of the tongue (and possibly the lips). Additionally, other habitual factors contributing to the anterior open bite must be identified during diagnosis to mitigate the risk of relapse during or after orthodontic treatment. These factors may include degenerative changes in the temporo-mandibular joint, growth hormone disturbances, rheumatic diseases, or, in rare instances, tumours (often requiring surgical intervention), among others. 219\nFig 10-5 Anterior open bite\nFig 10-4 Mandibular auto rotation during extrusion\n10. VERTICAL DISCREPANCYBreathing disorders are frequently associated with posterior crossbites and anterior open bites. Similar to deep bite cases, altering the vertical dimension in the posterior segments leads to mandibular auto-rotation, causing a change in anterior height. Thus, when addressing an anterior open bite, treatment planning should carefully consider the patient's smile, ensuring its harmony with the overall facial aesthetics. It's important to note that attempting to extrude maxillary anterior teeth in patients with a gummy smile before treatment is rarely advisable. When addressing both open bites and deep bites, understanding the concepts of absolute and relative intrusion/extrusion is crucial. Relative intrusion/extrusion pertains to changes in the inclination of the anterior teeth, giving the appearance of intrusion or extrusion without actual vertical movement (Fig 10-2,10-3). During the review of the digital setup, it's essential to recognise that there is no virtual articulator in the software to accurately position the bite. For instance, when planning to correct a deep bite by extruding posterior teeth, heavy occlusal contacts may appear in the digital setup. Conversely, when intruding posterior teeth, occlusal contacts may disappear in the software, which is also acceptable but can be frustrating as it provides no insight into occlusion until a refinement is initiated. (Fig 10-4 and 10-6) This discrepancy is acceptable because an auto-rotation of the mandible will occur clinically, causing changes not visible in the virtual treatment plan (Fig 10-6). Although occlusal contacts may not be visible in the software, some aligner software may simulate a \"bite jump.\" However, this simulation is not a realistic representation of the final occlusion. It only depicts an upward movement along the Y-axis without accounting for mandibular auto-rotation. In children, a bite jump may occur clinically as muscles adapt to the occlusion, potentially resulting in bone and joint changes. However, this adaptation rarely occurs in adults and may lead to temporomandibular joint disorders instead. To mitigate potential software issues in orthodontic treatment, it is advisable to plan the anterior relationships with a slight overjet. This approach helps prevent the development of primary contacts or an edge-to-edge relationship in the anterior segment. Additionally, anticipate the need for revisions later in the treatment to address any occlusal discrepancies. By planning for a slight overjet, you can avoid primary contacts in the front or an edge-to-edge bite and recognise that a revision will most likely be necessary at a later stage in the treatment as you have a highly biased simulation of the occlusion (if any) in the virtual treatment plan.

Additionally, intrusion can be facilitated with the assistance of TADs positioned on the buccal and lingual sides of the tooth or teeth requiring intrusion. Placing a TAD on each side of the dental arch allows for the attachment of elastic bands over the aligner, connecting the buccal TAD on one side to the lingual TAD on the other (Fig 10-7). This setup enhances forces and streamlines the intrusion process. For cases involving extensive anterior extrusions, box elastics can be advantageous (Fig 10-8). In this method, the maxillary and mandibular aligners are trimmed slightly in the cervical region to accommodate buttons bonded to the teeth. Elastic bands are then placed from the teeth designated for extrusion in the maxillary arch to those in the mandibular arch. This arrangement applies extrusive force, while the trimmed aligners guide the teeth into the desired positions. TIP no. 2: Anticipate the necessity for at least one revision in every deep bite and open bite treatment. Realising you will need to make changes in one or more revisions during treatment. You do not have to fiddle around making everything absolutely perfect in your virtual treatment plan prior to approving the setup. Simply split the treatment plan in two from the beginning.  Focus first on getting a better occlusion initially solving the deep- or open bite and plan in time to do one or two additional virtual treatment plans later during the treatment.  It is a good idea to inform the patient about this prior to starting treatment. This enables the patient to have realistic expectations from the beginning whereby you will decrease the risk of developing an unhappy or non-compliant patient. Redeeming the SmileDespite the setback, Sarah’s resilience and understanding provided a glimmer of hope. She was willing to endure a prolonged treatment to achieve the desired results, giving Dr. Hughes a chance to redeem the situation. Determined to make things right, Dr. Hughes devised a new plan in collaboration with AlignerService: move the anterior maxillary teeth back to their original position, expand the posterior segment, and intrude the maxillary molars and premolars using temporary anchorage devices (TADs). The process was gruelling, requiring not one but two midcourse revisions. Each adjustment was a lesson in humility and perseverance, a testament to the unpredictability of a vertical bite jump and the importance of meticulous planning. Dr. Hughes meticulously monitored the changes, ensuring that   221\nFig 10-7  Intrusions with TAD’s\nFig 10-8  Extrusions with box elastics",

TIP no. 2: Anticipate the necessity for at least one revision in every deep bite and open bite treatment. Realising you will need to make changes in one or more revisions during treatment. You do not have to fiddle around making everything absolutely perfect in your virtual treatment plan prior to approving the setup. Simply split the treatment plan in two from the beginning.  Focus first on getting a better occlusion initially solving the deep- or open bite and plan in time to do one or two additional virtual treatment plans later during the treatment.  It is a good idea to inform the patient about this prior to starting treatment. This enables the patient to have realistic expectations from the beginning whereby you will decrease the risk of developing an unhappy or non-compliant patient. Redeeming the SmileDespite the setback, Sarah’s resilience and understanding provided a glimmer of hope. She was willing to endure a prolonged treatment to achieve the desired results, giving Dr. Hughes a chance to redeem the situation. Determined to make things right, Dr. Hughes devised a new plan in collaboration with AlignerService: move the anterior maxillary teeth back to their original position, expand the posterior segment, and intrude the maxillary molars and premolars using temporary anchorage devices (TADs). The process was gruelling, requiring not one but two midcourse revisions. Each adjustment was a lesson in humility and perseverance, a testament to the unpredictability of a vertical bite jump and the importance of meticulous planning. Dr. Hughes meticulously monitored the changes, ensuring that   221\nFig 10-7  Intrusions with TAD’s\nFig 10-8  Extrusions with box elastics\n10. VERTICAL DISCREPANCYthe occlusion was corrected in a predictable and controlled manner. Months later, the results were in. Sarah’s occlusion was significantly improved, and her smile was now wider and more harmonious. The gummy smile, though still present, was less pronounced and less noticeable. The smile that had once been a source of frustration and disappointment now complemented her facial features, making it less apparent and more aesthetically pleasing. Dr. Hughes breathed a sigh of relief, grateful for Sarah’s patience and trust. The journey had been fraught with challenges, but it had also been a profound learning experience. The case had underscored the importance of integrating extraoral photos into virtual treatment planning and the necessity of being prepared for revisions. As Sarah left the clinic with her new smile, Dr. Hughes couldn’t help but feel a sense of accomplishment. The road had been long and difficult, but in the end, they had achieved a result that was both functionally and aesthetically satisfying. The experience had transformed not just Sarah’s smile, but also Dr. Hughes’ approach to orthodontic treatment, blending the precision of technology with the irreplaceable nuance of human expertise. \n  222",

SAGITTAL DISCREPANCYSAGITTAL DISCREPANCY 225 11. SAGITTAL DISCREPANCYSAGITTAL DISCREPANCY Sagittal discrepancies are about the molar and canine relationships. A discrepancy is an Angle class II or class III (Chapter 3 Fig. 3-29 - 3-32). When Digital Promises Create Doubt Dr. Reynolds stared at the treatment plan on his computer screen with a sinking feeling in his stomach. He had trusted the clear aligner company's software to guide him through the complex case of a Class II sagittal discrepancy. The digital setup had promised a transformation: expansive arches, meticulous interproximal reduction (IPR) in the mandible, and a sagittal bite jump that seemingly corrected the occlusion into a perfect Class I alignment due to the use of class II elastics. On screen, it looked flawless - a virtual marvel where the mandibular arch magically realigned to fit an ideal occlusion. Yet, in the back of his mind, doubts gnawed. He had heard murmurs among colleagues about the risks of relying too heavily on digital simulations, especially in cases with significant skeletal discrepancies. Could the software really deliver on such ambitious promises? As he scrolled through the treatment steps, a sense of unease grew. What if this digital perfection didn't translate into reality? What if, instead of correcting the patient's sagittal discrepancy, he exacerbated it? The thought sent a chill down his spine. He had seen cases where such overzealous treatments resulted in disastrous outcomes—patients left worse off than before, requiring extensive surgical intervention to correct misalignments that clear aligners alone couldn't fix. Dr. Reynolds knew he needed to act fast. If he didn't intervene now and correct the digital setup into a realistic virtual treatment plan, he risked not just the patient's dental health but also their overall well-being. The stakes were high, and the responsibility weighed heavily on his shoulders. Class II Treatment strategies for Angle class II discrepancies vary depending on individual patient factors. Distinctions must be made between adult patients and those still undergoing growth, as treatment approaches differ significantly. One crucial factor is determining whether the discrepancy is skeletal or dental in nature. For adult patients, especially those utilising clear aligners, achieving sagittal corrections necessitates a stable bite. Additionally, identifying whether the deviation is a Class II division 1 or 2 is vital. Assessing the patient's profile and the magnitude of the Class II discrepancy are equally important. The overjet size should be evaluated in relation to the patient's smile and profile aesthetics. While distalising posterior teeth in the maxilla might seem feasible, it must be weighed against potential negative impacts on the patient's profile and smile aesthetics. In cases where reducing the overjet would improve the profile, sequential distalisation can be an effective approach. However, if the discrepancy is mainly skeletal, dental compensation for the skeletal misalignment may be considered, but orthognathic surgery is often the more appropriate solution. The decision depends on several factors, including facial profile and aesthetics, occlusion, functional considerations, and patient preferences. 226 11. SAGITTAL DISCREPANCYSequential distalisation Treatment with sequential distalisation is typically a lengthy process, especially if the third molar is present. In such cases, it's often recommended to extract the third molar to facilitate treatment. Our approach involves employing the \"50% protocol\" for distalisation, where the second molar is moved 50% toward its final position before initiating movement of the first molar. This sequential progression continues through the premolars as described. Once the molars and premolars have been distalised to their planned position. The anterior teeth need to be retracted with bodily movements. Here it is really important to consider the type of anchorage, as anchorage using class II elastics or elastics connected to TAD’s is always needed. If class II elastics or elastics connected to TAD’s are not applied, the distalisation of the molars and the retraction of the anterior teeth will not happen fully as planned. The standard protocol for distalisation with clear aligners prescribes class II elastics in cases with more than 4 millimetres of distalisation. However we recommend class II elastics for all cases with more than 2 millimetres of distalisation. For patients with a Class II Division 2 occlusion, proclining the maxillary anterior teeth while simultaneously distalising the molars can enhance anchorage by utilising the opposing forces. When planning this treatment, the extent of distalisation and the amount of overjet must be carefully evaluated. Depending on these factors, it may be necessary to perform IPR to achieve optimal results. In patients with a stable occlusion but with Class II molar relationships, the canine relationship may be improved by performing posterior IPR) only. In such cases, it is not necessary to use Class II elastics, as the posterior movements required are less than 2 millimetres. Additionally, if the first molar is mesially rotated, it is advisable to rotate it into its ideal position. This rotation creates ample space, reducing the need for extensive IPR and facilitating the improvement of the Class II relationship. A rotation of a maxillary molar typically occurs around the palatal root. To ensure a predictable movement, it is important to place a vertical engager on the first molar during rotation. Growth simulation As previously mentioned. Some aligner systems incorporate a feature known as a \"bite jump\" in their planning software. This simulation is supposed to mimic the anticipated mandibular growth and muscular adaptation to the occlusion, typically observed in growing children. The bite jump portrays an anterior movement of the mandible in the sagittal direction. When class II elastics are applied to influence mandibular growth in children, it can indeed affect this growth, although the extent is not definitively established and is generally estimated to be around 20% of the expected growth and may vary a lot from one individual to another. In children experiencing their second growth spurt, the mandible naturally tends to grow faster than the maxilla. In such cases, simulating the changes occurring in the mandible digitally, as represented by the bite jump, aligns with the anticipated growth trajectory. However, it's crucial to recognise that this simulated jump does not necessarily manifest clinically and when it does, never as an instantaneous movement. Rather it evolves gradually over time, potentially resulting in a transition from a Class II to a Class I molar 227 11. SAGITTAL DISCREPANCYand canine relationship during growth. This phenomenon, however, is specific to children and should not be extrapolated to adult patients. Once again, we would like to emphasise that children should be treated by orthodontists, who possess the specialised knowledge required to manage their growth and development effectively. The extensive training and experience gained over several years are essential for ensuring the best outcomes in paediatric orthodontic care. Despite the visual representation in the digital setup, it's imperative to acknowledge that what occurs on the computer screen may not necessarily translate directly to the clinical setting. Therefore, the digital treatment plan often requires modification to align with the clinical scenario, including the bite.",

Therefore, the digital treatment plan often requires modification to align with the clinical scenario, including the bite.\n\nFailure to do so can lead to undesired clinical outcomes, necessitating additional aligners or revisions and potentially causing harm to the patient's dentition by moving teeth beyond the confines of the bone. Furthermore, performing mesial or distal translations of mandibular molars is inherently less predictable than similar movements in the maxilla. To address molar relationships while moving the mandible, several considerations must be taken into account during treatment planning. These include assessing the extent of crowding, evaluating the patient's profile and biotype, and considering the risk of creating recessions. Answering these questions helps determine the most suitable treatment protocol for the individual patient. Class III Treating patients with a Class III molar relationship poses considerable challenges due to the inherent limitations in bone structure and tooth mobility. Achieving distalisation of mandibular molars for comprehensive corrections is particularly arduous, especially when attempting to use bodily movements. In cases where the clinical crowns of mandibular molars are tipped mesially, partial Class III correction can be achieved by slowly distally tipping the crowns, creating a pseudo-distalisation effect. The approach to treatment varies based on the severity of the Class III molar relationship. It's essential to assess whether the discrepancy is primarily skeletal, necessitating surgical intervention, or if it's predominantly dental and can be addressed through tooth movements alone. In Class III patients with mandibular anterior crowding, there is often a risk of developing an anterior crossbite when attempting to align the teeth. Unlike in growing individuals, correcting the jaw relationship without surgery in adult patients is not feasible. Since clear aligner treatments in a general dental practice are predominantly performed on adults, who often prefer non-surgical options for both aesthetic reasons and to avoid potential damage to the mandibular nerve, finding an effective solution with minimal risk is paramount, especially if a dysfunctional occlusion is diagnosed. Extractions Mandibular anterior crowding compromises tooth alignment, and mere IPR is insufficient to resolve the anterior crossbite or the class III relationship. In such cases, extraction therapy becomes a viable option, either involving incisor or premolar extraction. However, extracting teeth adds a lot of complexity to the treatment process. It is notably challenging to control tooth movements, trying to close extraction sites with clear aligners. Therefore, achieving the appropriate amount of root movement, rather than mere crown tipping, is crucial. This necessitates the use of large vertical   228",

When deciding to extract a mandibular incisor, careful consideration must be given to which tooth is selected for removal. Typically, the tooth that is most compromised and would require the most root movement if left in place is chosen. This approach aims to minimise the overall movement needed for the remaining teeth during orthodontic treatment. Depending on the planned movements of the mandibular teeth, Class III elastics may be considered to enhance anchorage. In patients with an Angle Class III molar relationship, it is crucial to assess the inclination of the mandibular incisors. It is common to observe changes in the inclination of these teeth to align with the maxillary anterior teeth. Consequently, the mandibular anterior teeth may become lingually inclined. While this may not perfectly align with certain functional occlusion philosophies, it typically does not pose a significant challenge, as most Class III patients exhibit minimal mandibular articulation movements. Diagnostic tip As with all other cases, thorough diagnosis is essential prior to treatment planning for patients with a Class III relationship. One intriguing observation in many Class III patients is their limited mandibular articulation movements. These individuals often predominantly utilise hinge axis movement and exhibit minimal side-to-side movement or protrusion of the mandible during function. As a result, there is a decreased risk of functional problems related to tooth wear, which is reflected in the reduced presence of wear facets on their teeth. However, it is important to recognise that some patients develop a Class III relationship as an unconscious adaptation by the body to mitigate harmful occlusion. This can involve protruding the mandible to find a less detrimental biting position. Such patients often exhibit multiple wear facets on both anterior and posterior teeth. Initiating aligner treatment without a thorough diagnosis of the occlusion in centric relation (CR) may increase the risk of patients altering their maximum intercuspation position (MIP) during treatment. This can happen as their muscles relax and the temporomandibular joints settle into the fossa. From Risk to Reward Several weeks later, Dr. Reynolds leaned back in his chair with a sense of relief mingled with cautious optimism. With our guidance, he had meticulously revised the treatment plan into a more realistic and predictable approach. Instead of relying solely on expansive arches and bite jumps, they had focused on gradual, controlled movements that respected the patient's skeletal limitations. The revised plan included strategic IPR in the mandible to alleviate anterior crowding without compromising stability. They had also adjusted the digital setup to account for the patient's Class II sagittal discrepancy more conservatively, avoiding the pitfalls of overcorrection and the use of a digital bite jump, that would never happen in reality. As the treatment progressed, Dr. Reynolds monitored the patient closely to ensure each step aligned with the revised virtual plan. It was a collaborative effort, with AlignerService providing expertise and support at every stage. Months passed, and the results spoke for themselves. The patient's sagittal discrepancy had   229\n11. SAGITTAL DISCREPANCYbeen addressed effectively, with improvements in both function and aesthetics. There were no signs of the severe misalignments that had haunted Dr. Reynolds' initial fears. The patient's smile was transforming, and more importantly, the dental health was secure. Reflecting on the journey, Dr. Reynolds felt a sense of gratitude for having caught the potential pitfalls early. The experience had reinforced the importance of thorough diagnosis, realistic treatment planning, and vigilant oversight in clear aligner therapy. He knew that moving forward, he would approach similar cases with greater caution and expertise, ensuring that each patient received the best possible care from start to finish. \n  230\n11. SAGITTAL DISCREPANCYActionable Tips 1. Assess skeletal vs. dental nature ★Determine if the discrepancy is primarily skeletal or dental. ★For skeletal discrepancies, consider orthognathic surgery. ★For dental compensations, assess overjet and profile aesthetics to guide treatment. 2.Sequential distalisation strategy ★For Class II cases, use sequential distalisation starting with molars, then premolars, and finally anterior teeth. ★Implement Class II elastics for any distalisation over 2 mm. ★Monitor anchorage carefully; consider TADs or Class II elastics to enhance stability and control movement. 3.Proclining maxillary anteriors in class II division 2 ★Procline anterior teeth during molar distalisation to improve anchorage and balance forces. ★Evaluate the need for IPR to optimise overjet correction and enhance alignment. 4.Avoid reliance on bite jumps ★Be cautious of \"bite jump\" simulations in digital setups, especially in adults. ★Always compare digital plans with clinical realities - skeletal discrepancies may require adjustments beyond digital simulations. 5.Class III treatment considerations ★In cases of Class III discrepancies, assess if dental tipping or distalising mandibular molars can improve alignment, but acknowledge its unpredictability. ★For severe cases, evaluate extraction options and be prepared for slower tooth movements using power arms and large vertical attachments. 6.Extraction Protocols ★Consider referring the patient to an orthodontist!  ★For crowding or severe Class III issues, consider incisor or premolar extractions. ★Ensure root movement is precise and controlled with power arms to avoid crown tipping. ★Consider Class III elastics for anchorage when closing extraction spaces. 7.Diagnostic Tips ★Thoroughly assess mandibular articulation and function before planning treatment. ★Pay attention to wear facets and muscular adaptations to avoid functional problems post-treatment. By applying these tips, you can mitigate risks and achieve a more predictable, stable outcome for patients with sagittal discrepancies. \n  231",

TRANSVERSAL DISCREPANCYTRANSVERSAL DISCREPANCY If the discrepancy is minor and primarily dental, involving expansion or compression of less than 2 millimetres per quadrant, aligners can correct it, provided there is sufficient bone support. The diagnosis differentiates between dental and skeletal crossbites, noting that unilateral crossbites are frequently linked to facial asymmetry or a notable occlusal slide, particularly when of skeletal origin. When a patient presents with a narrow dental arch, expanding the molars and premolars may be a viable option, contingent upon the extent of buccal bone available. A narrow smile, typically characterised by fewer than 10 visible maxillary teeth, indicates insufficient arch width (Fig 12-1, 12-2). Adequate buccal bone facilitates the necessary expansion, with clear aligners currently capable of predictably expanding by about 2 millimetres per quadrant. However, it's crucial to monitor the speed of planned movements in the software to avoid excessive buccal crown tipping compared to buccal translation. A posterior crossbite may arise if only the maxillary arch form is compromised (Fig 12-3). The severity of the crossbite and whether it only involves an underdeveloped maxilla or both jaws influence treatment decisions.  Consider the use of a CBCT scan to evaluate buccal bone support around the molars and premolars. This will help to confirm whether the buccal bone is sufficient for the planned expansion.   234\nFig 12-3 Narrow arches front view \nFig 12-2 Narrow smile\nFig 12-1 Occlusal view narrow arch",

DIGITAL SETUP REVIEWDIGITAL SETUP REVIEW In this section, you will be shown a step by step procedure, that illustrates exactly how to use a standardised method to control and adjust the digital setup created by the clear aligner company (ie. the aligner technicians or artificial intelligence).  Since each clear aligner system has its unique nuances, we’ve included a detailed guide on how to review setups for four of the major clear aligner systems we work with. This will help you navigate the specific features and requirements of each system with confidence.  When the first digital setup returns from the clear aligner technicians, a review needs to be performed to ensure every part of the digital setup matches the treatment plan you have worked out for the patient. It is very important to make sure that every part of the digital setup is correct, and that the planned tooth movements stay within the biological and clinical boundaries. In addition, the sequence of the movements and the movement speed will have to be controlled to ensure the virtual treatment plan will be realistic and predictable. If you are planning advanced tooth movements checking the placement of cutouts for buttons, slits or hooks also have to be controlled (and often corrected). From Digital Perfection to Real-World Complexity In the early days of our journey with clear aligners, we were captivated by the sleek, polished digital setups that the aligner companies presented on our computer screens. It was like peering into a futuristic world where every tooth was perfectly aligned, every movement precisely planned. We believed wholeheartedly in what we saw. The visual representation was so compelling that it felt almost magical - a blueprint for flawless treatment outcomes. We never doubted that what we were looking at was anything less than an accurate depiction of the reality we would create for our patients. But then, as we began treating patients, something unsettling started to happen. The reality we encountered in our dental practice was often starkly different from the digital perfection we had been shown on the computer screen. Teeth weren’t moving as predicted, treatments were dragging on far longer than anticipated, and the outcomes were frequently less than ideal. The confidence we initially had in the digital setups began to waver. How could the same technology that promised such precision and efficiency result in treatments that were, at times, unpredictable and frustratingly prolonged? It took time - more time than we’d care to admit - before we began to grasp the underlying issue. The digital setups, though beautifully rendered, were often based on generic algorithms and assumptions that didn’t always align with the complexities of real-life orthodontics. The aligner companies were creating these setups using the principles of conventional orthodontics - biomechanics designed for brackets and wires - without fully accounting for the unique challenges of clear aligners. To be frank, in those early days, no one really knew what would work and what wouldn’t. The technology was so new, and we were all still figuring out how to navigate this uncharted   238",

She learned about the software, the industrialised production processes, and the intricate post-production workflows. Armed with this knowledge and our clinical experience, she started to see the full picture. It wasn’t enough to rely on the aligner companies’ digital setups; we needed to take control of all the parts of the treatment planning ourselves, even taking care to plan correctly in regards to the aligner production in some instances. As Helle delved deeper into the process, she began to develop her own treatment preferences, honed by countless cases and challenges from practices worldwide. She realised that while the aligner companies could provide a starting point, it was up to us, the clinicians, to refine and perfect the digital setups. Initially, we had to write out our preferences manually, guiding the aligner technicians step by step. But as time passed, software evolved, offering us more tools and control. Today, many of our preferences can be directly integrated into the software, making the initial digital setups better than ever before. However, the reality remains that treating patients orthodontically with clear aligners is still a complex and nuanced endeavour. Every system differs a little from its competitors making it important to really understand all aspects of the chosen system. Despite advances in technology, there’s no substitute for the knowledge and experience of the clinician. The aligner companies may provide the tools, but it’s the clinician who must wield them effectively, ensuring that the virtual treatment plans are not just theoretically sound, but clinically realistic and predictable. Reflecting on our early experiences, we see now how much we’ve learned and grown. The mistakes we made were painful, not just for us but also for our patients. But they were also invaluable lessons that have shaped the way we approach treatment today. We’ve moved from being passive recipients of digital setups to active participants in the planning process, ensuring that every aspect of the treatment is tailored to the unique needs of each patient. As you embark on this journey, we’re excited to share with you a systematic 5 step protocol we've developed, drawing on our collective experience from crafting over 17,000 clear aligner treatment plans for more than 1500 different dental offices around the world. These approaches have been honed to help you sidestep the challenges we've faced and to create treatment plans that are not only visually appealing but also highly effective in practice. Our initial path wasn’t without its challenges, but it was essential in building the expertise we have today. Now, we stand on solid ground, armed with the knowledge and tools to create predictable and successful treatments. We hope that by sharing our journey, you’ll find it easier to navigate this complex landscape, with a greater sense of confidence and clarity. The 5 step protocol Here are some crucial points that need to be reviewed to ensure the digital setup is correct and that the movements are clinically realistic, safe, and predictable: 239 13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW1.Check the initial bite setting. 2.Check the end result. 3.Check all of the tooth movements: Velocity, sequence and staging of the movements. 4.Make corrections to the end result of the setup. Modifying the treatment setup and the tooth movements to be realistic, safe and predictable. 5.Submit the changes to the setup or approve the setup 1. The bite setting During the initial review of a new digital setup, the first aspect that must be meticulously examined is the bite setting. Ensuring the accuracy of the digital model's bite setting is of utmost importance. The initial bite setting in the digital setup should precisely correspond to the patient's clinical bite. In cases where no digital bite registration has been provided from an intraoral (IO) scanner, the technicians will rely on clinical photos to establish the digital bite. It's essential to ensure the bite is accurately set before moving forward with the digital setup. Compare the digital bite setting with the clinical photos to verify accuracy. If the initial bite isn't correctly established digitally, it will result in faulty clinical outcomes, potentially requiring extensive modifications and multiple revisions later in the treatment process. For instance, if the initial bite setting inaccurately displays a smaller overjet than clinically present prior to treatment initiation, it could lead to excessive IPR planned in the mandibular arch. Conversely, the patient may end up with a larger overjet in the clinical end result. Performing unnecessary IPR clinically poses a risk of unfavourable outcomes for both the patient and the doctor. Once the enamel has been removed during IPR it will never grow back. Therefore, ensuring precise control and adjustment of the bite setting is paramount as the first step in the digital setup review. This establishes a solid foundation for virtual treatment planning and prevents unnecessary time spent on adjustments. With the correct bite setting, there is a higher likelihood of the clinical end result aligning with the digital setup in the doctor portal. If the bite is found to be incorrect, it is crucial to provide clear instructions to the technicians on how to accurately set it before making any further adjustments to the digital setup. Each time the technicians alter the bite setting, the new configuration must be carefully checked for accuracy. Although this may require additional time, ensuring the accuracy of the bite setting is essential. It's important to note that an IO-scan does not guarantee a correct bite registration, as many patients naturally protrude slightly when instructed to bite together during scanning. Even if the bite is set according to a digital bite scan, it still needs to be matched with the clinical photos for accuracy. Tip: During the intraoral bite scan, instruct the patient to bite firmly on their posterior teeth. This increases the likelihood of capturing a bite registration without any protrusion. 2. Check the end result With the bite correctly set, proceed directly to the final step in the digital setup to review the end result. A.Evaluate whether it aligns with your overall treatment plan for the patient. 240 13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEWB.Double check this in relation to your extraoral and intraoral photos. (If you have a Digital Smile Design planned, use this to help you evaluate the planned treatment outcome) C.Assess the aesthetics of the setup. Key considerations: •Does the virtual treatment plan achieve a pleasing aesthetic appearance? •Are the relationships between the maxillary and mandibular arches satisfactory? •Is the occlusion properly aligned? •Overall, are you satisfied with the final outcome? 241",

These functions can help ensure that the virtual treatment plan meets your expectations and goals for the patient's treatment outcome. You can access the functions from two different views in the setup. One option is to use the icons located in the top left corner (Fig 13a-1). Alternatively, you can enable the left side menu. We recommend using the left side menu, as it allows for quicker and easier navigation between different features with just a single click. The toolbar can also be customised to display your most frequently used features in the left side toolbar (Fig 13a-2). The following illustrations will demonstrate the use of the left side menu.

Now the purple teeth and the white teeth can be compared to see how far, and in which directions the teeth have been planned to move. Bring out the clinical photos to assess whether the planned tooth movements in the digital plan are realistic and within clinical boundaries. It's crucial to compare the digital setup with the photos, paying particular attention to the biotype, not only in the anterior maxillary and mandibular regions but in the posterior areas as well. In cases with a thin biotype, where the roots are visible through the gingiva, exercise caution with any planned buccal translation of the teeth. Excessive buccal movement can lead to buccal bone loss and associated gingival recession (Fig 13a-4). For cases with a thin biotype, an alternative to buccal translation is to plan controlled buccal crown tipping. Be aware that this approach still carries a risk of recession, but the tissue loss is generally limited to the coronal part of the bone and gingiva. Depending on the tooth inclination, adding some lingual root torque may also be beneficial. Next step:  Remove superimpose and activate occlusal marks (Fig 13a-5). We prefer the opaque teeth(not transparent) version of the models when we look at the occlusal marks as we find it makes it easier to evaluate the distribution of the occlusal marks. 243\nFig 13a-4 Intra oral photos. Thin biotype\nFig 13a-5 Occlusal contacts\n13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEWClick the “+” button to make the teeth more opaque. Check the occlusion at the end of the treatment. As to our clinical preferences, we prefer not to have any occlusal contacts on the incisors. In addition, we like to have the occlusal contacts evenly spread from the canines on all poster teeth. In patients with a deep bite, we plan the posterior occlusion to be heavy. This because the software displays a static image and not models mounted in an articulator. To compensate for this we have to imagine the clinical outcome in the digital setup and track the movements clinically to verify whether or not we achieve our treatment goals or if a revision will be needed. Posterior extrusion is rarely expressed clinically as it appears in the virtual treatment plan. In part, it is difficult to achieve posterior extrusion due to the occlusal forces. Secondly, the digital setup is not mounted in a virtual articulator. By embedding the hard occlusion in the digital setup, we can get an approximate  idea of where the occlusion can be expected. In combination with our clinical experience, we can visualise the end result ourselves and get a sense of how the plan should be designed to minimise the likelihood of a revision. If a revision becomes necessary, the movements required at this stage will usually be relatively limited. Please note that the software offers a bite jump visualisation feature. However, we do not recommend using bite jumps, as they do not accurately simulate mandibular movements during occlusal changes. Instead, focusing on hard contacts provides a more reliable indication of the planned changes. These hard contacts can be better interpreted by a dentist than the current computer simulations available. 3. Checking the tooth movements, the velocity, the sequence and staging Step 1. Open the \"movement chart\" to evaluate the planned tooth movements. First, check that the movement velocity is not too fast. As a rule of thumb no tooth should rotate more than 2° per stage. Intrusion, extrusion, and translation should \n  244\nFig 13a-6 Move chart step-by-step and cumulative (showing the entire movements on last stage)\n13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEWbe limited to no more than 0.2 mm per stage. However the shape and size of a tooth may reduce these numbers even more, depending on the planned movements. In the ClearPilot software, go to the bottom left corner of the screen and click on the “per step” text. This will highlight and display the planned values for each stage of the treatment (Fig 13a-6). At the last stage of treatment, it can be an advantage to switch to “cumulative”. This gives an overview of all the cumulative movements for a specific tooth in a given direction throughout the entire treatment. It is good to know how far a tooth is being planned to move to easily evaluate if the movement is realistic within the given time, and in general in the entire treatment. Step 2 Review all movements meticulously, for instance, planned expansions, while considering Newton's third law in conjunction with anchorage principles. Analyse all the movements and the forces necessary to move the teeth, along with the corresponding forces generated simultaneously. For instance, simultaneous expansion on both the left and right sides should be executed to leverage forces evenly across the jaw. If distalisation is part of the treatment plan, ensure sequential distalisation employing the 50% protocol is adhered to (Fig 13a-7). Remember, the 50% protocol entails initiating movement of the most distal upper molar as the sole tooth. Once it has progressed 50% toward its final destination, the adjacent molar begins movement. This sequential progression continues, with each successive tooth initiating movement once the preceding tooth has reached its intended final position in the jaw. In addition to controlling the movements and the dental anchorage applied. Think about the possible use of auxiliaries or TADs. In the example above, class II elastics may have to be added to make the digital setup realistic and predictable. These anchorage strategies are usually not applied to the digital setup by the aligner technicians and therefore have to be applied by the treating doctor or a collaborator. Once the movement pattern has been established, consider the planned anchorage and determine the appropriate type for the specific case:  •Temporary Anchorage Devices (TADs)  •Class II elastics •An alternative option. Once the required anchorage is determined, incorporate the necessary cutouts into the setup, ensuring they appear only on the aligners where and when they are needed. In cases requiring Class II elastics, the cutouts must be included in the aligner plan to facilitate an effective clinical workflow. For instance, in the case of Class II division 2, simultaneous distalisation with proclination will aid in proclining the upper front teeth, unless Class II elastics are attached to a slit or hook in the aligner, which would exert a \n  245\nFig 13a-7 Sequential distalisation only molar movements. 13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEWdownward and distal force on the anterior teeth and thereby work against the proclination. Always consider Newton's third law, ensuring that none of the movements contradict each other. For example, attempting to intrude a maxillary canine while applying Class II elastics will result in extrusion forced applied to the canine, hindering the desired intrusion or even worse resulting in the extrusion of the tooth instead.",

For example, attempting to intrude a maxillary canine while applying Class II elastics will result in extrusion forced applied to the canine, hindering the desired intrusion or even worse resulting in the extrusion of the tooth instead.\n\nThese kind of single tooth failures rarely affect one tooth alone as the tracking issues related to a single tooth will typically result in a deflection of the aligner from other teeth as well. Planning cutouts for buttons bonded to the teeth or slits in the aligner acting as hooks is possible, each with its advantages and disadvantages. We generally advise against attempting bodily movements on mandibular molars, as it often results in crown tipping rather than true root movement. To achieve mesial or distal movement of mandibular molars, auxiliaries such as TADs and/or power arms are necessary. If these auxiliaries are planned as part of a treatment, corresponding cutouts must be added to the digital setup by the treating doctor. Teeth undergoing extensive movements, such as significant rotation and extrusion, require staged planning to enhance predictability. For example, planning rotation with a vertical engager followed by extrusion with a horizontal engager simplifies the movements and increases the predictability considerably (but may  prolong the treatment time. At least in the digital setup). Predictability Indicators: •Yellow triangles  Indicate that the movements may be moderately complex due to a moderate amount of planned movement. •Red triangles  Signal that a significant amount of movement is planned, suggesting higher complexity. These predictability indicators can be toggled on or off. They help assess the predictability of each movement within the range defined by the aligner company. However, this does not necessarily mean that a specific case will have unpredictable movements. The predictability largely depends on the planned movements and the theoretical and clinical experience of the doctor conducting the digital treatment planning (Fig 13a-8). Staging the movements improves clinical predictability but prolongs treatment duration in the digital setup, as more stages and aligners are needed. Despite appearing longer, treatments with continuous light forces are generally more effective clinically, necessitating fewer revisions and additional aligners. 246\nFig 13a-8  Predictability alerts",

This is where specificity becomes important. Vague requests will most often lead to confusion. Here are some examples of unspecific requests that can cause misunderstandings: -Align maxillary teeth better -Rotate more -Use less IPR  -Improve midline As these examples illustrate the technicians will be challenged if you do not give them very specific orders.  Across all aligner companies, the aligner technicians will do their best to follow your instructions. This means that if they receive a broad unspecific request, they will do their best to follow that request. However that rarely leads to the results you really want as it becomes up to the technician to interpret the request to the best of their ability. Since aligner technicians only rarely have a dental background and none of them are orthodontists, they do not possess the ability to think like an orthodontist or general dentist.  Take a look at the examples of unspecific requests and consider how you interpret each one. This exercise is valuable whenever you communicate with a clear aligner technician, as it highlights the importance of clarity and specificity.  -Align maxillary teeth better (how?) -Rotate less (Which teeth? How much do you want to rotate?) -Use less IPR (Where? Then do what instead?) -Improve midline (How?) Please note that we do not include explanations for why changes are requested. Aligner technicians do not need this information, as it varies from doctor to doctor and most technicians lack the educational background to understand such descriptions. Providing unnecessary explanations would only waste their time and yours. DoctorEdit In DoctorEdit there are many different possibilities to change the setup. Tooth movements, and features such as engagers, cutouts and bite ramps can be modified, added or removed. To be able to start editing the tooth's final position, first click on the pen, and then double-click on the tooth that you would like to make changes to (Fig 13a-10). This action opens a toolbar. The toolbar contains the tools needed for all the different directions the tooth can be moved. The values shown in the toolbar are a visualisation of the specific tooth movement planned in the given direction that the specific tooth will be moving throughout the entire treatment. These values can also be seen in the movement chart. Clicking on the arrows in the toolbar will move the tooth in   248\nFig 13a-10 Edit tooth position",

This makes it easy to get an overview of which teeth have been moved using the DoctorEdit tool. The values in the movement chart also change colour when modifications are made using the DoctorEdit software. While working in DoctorEdit mode, you can quickly toggle between the initial stage and the technician’s final stage by clicking the buttons to the right of the timeline (Fig 13a-11). Changing the IPR can be done in two different ways. You can either move the teeth in a mesial/distal and/or lingual/buccal direction using the arrows in the toolbar (Fig 13a-10). This adjustment affects the approximal contacts, and the software will automatically add or reduce the amount of IPR between the teeth accordingly. The other way to change the IPR is to click on the IPR -/+ button (Fig 13a-12). This allows you to directly adjust the exact amount of IPR shown between the teeth. Be aware that using this method will cause two teeth on both sides of the IPR to move in a direction dictated by the software. To avoid this, consider changing the IPR by moving the teeth in the desired direction instead.  C-Chain Clinically, cases involving significant IPR can sometimes result in residual spaces or contact points that are too loose. To address this, virtual C-chain stages can be added to the treatment plan. These stages work by tightening the contact points through lingual translation of the anterior teeth, from canine to canine. Custom modifications to the C-chain stages can also be requested as needed. In the treatment timeline, C-chain stages are displayed as the final two stages before the \"R\" stage and are underlined for easy identification in the software overview (Fig 13a-13).  If good approximal contacts are observed clinically before reaching the C-chain stages, it may not be necessary to use those aligners.

To avoid this, you can revert to the previous aligner, effectively returning the treatment to a prior stage. Engagers It is fairly easy to change, add, or remove engagers and other features in DoctorEdit mode. Simply click the feature tab and then select the button for the feature you want to work with (Fig 13a-14). This will open a new toolbar with options for the specific feature. Clicking on the engager button allows you to add, change, or delete engagers (Fig 13a-15). You can choose between vertical and horizontal engagers and adjust their length, height, and exact position on the tooth. Additionally, you can change the direction and angulation of the engager. This feature enables you to optimise the position of an engager for more complex movements that require channelling the forces of the aligner in a specific direction. For example in theory you can place an engager diagonally on the tooth surface to assist with both extrusion and rotation, creating a more predictable movement.  You can also select an engager with a bevel if you believe that increasing the surface area will positively impact force distribution and the planned movements. However, it is important to note that while beveled engagers are often considered theoretically beneficial, their clinical impact has not been conclusively proven. On the feature toolbar, you can add button cutouts and slits/hooks for elastics (Fig 13a-16). As mentioned, elastics are often used to enhance anchorage. Button cutouts can be placed on any selected tooth, and you can adjust their position if the ClearCorrect technicians initially place them incorrectly. If you need to position a button at a specific location on a tooth (such as a molar), you can place it virtually in the exact planned spot and order a corresponding cutout for that location. In ClearCorrect aligners, it is even possible to include both a cutout for a button and an engager on the same molar. Buttons or slits/hooks can be positioned on either the buccal or lingual surface of a tooth. Please note that buttons are not included with the   250\nFig 13a-15 Edit engagers\nFig 13a-14 Features \n13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW\naligners and must be ordered separately. You can use either metal or plastic buttons, as long as they fit the size of the cutout.  Bite ramps Last but not least there is a bite ramp feature (Fig 13a-17). Bite ramps can be placed on the palatal surface of the maxillary anterior teeth from canine to canine. It is possible to choose to have bite ramps on the incisors only, on the canines only, or on all of the anterior teeth. In addition, it is possible to remove one bite ramp on a specific tooth. This can be done if there is no effect in that location anyway or if say a tooth is considered too fragile for the pressure pre-restoratively during orthodontic treatment.     Anterior bite ramps are being used for two different purposes:  1.Raise the bite to enable an easier treatment of a crossbite. (Letting the tooth or the teeth in a cross-bite relationship transition easier to their final position).  2.Improve the probability of a posterior extrusion in treatments with the need for an anterior intrusion and a posterior extrusion. Biting on the anterior teeth alone will not increase the bite forces on the anterior teeth as the bite ramps will function as a deprogrammer. This will reduce the muscle forces. However, by preventing occlusal contact on the posterior teeth, they may increase the probability of planned posterior extrusion. (It is debatable whether or not posterior extruded teeth will remain in their new position as the vertical dimension over time typically will be defined by the muscles and not the teeth. Posterior bite ramps can be applied to all molars or selectively to those needed for a specific case. They can be used universally or specifically on mandibular teeth for simplified planning. There is an option to initially include bite ramps on all posterior teeth and then easily remove any undesired ones with a single click. Posterior bite ramps are utilised to elevate the bite in cases of excessive overjet or when planned adjustments to the anterior teeth conflict with anterior bite ramps. \n  251\nFig 13a-17 Bite ramps\nFig 13a-16 Cutouts",

If you are satisfied with the setup as it is, return to the doctor portal and approve the setup (Fig 13a-18).  Once your virtual treatment plan is approved, you will be redirected to a page where you need to select a pricing plan. Different plans are available depending on the complexity of the treatment. While every effort is made to create a virtual treatment plan that is as predictable, safe, and realistic as possible, factors such as biological variability and patient compliance can still lead to tracking issues, especially in complex cases. When selecting a pricing plan, consider the risk of tracking issues and the number of included revisions. It can be both costly and frustrating to require additional revisions during treatment if they are not covered by your plan. Additionally, retreating a patient due to a minor relapse two years after the initial treatment can be expensive if the wrong pricing plan was chosen initially.  Arch edit, Tilt cant or rotation of models & Bite jump  Tilt cant or rotation of models (Fig 13a-19):  Working with virtual models oriented horizontally in the same way as your clinical photos simplifies the comparison of planned tooth positions with the clinical photos and/or a waxup of the desired ortho-restorative outcome. Sometimes, the dental arches are positioned differently in the digital setup compared to the horizontal lines of the clinical photos. The arch edit tool allows you to adjust the virtual position of the models directly, saving time and avoiding the need to explain your preferred model position to a clear aligner technician, who may have limited dental knowledge. Bite Jump The bite jump option allows you to manually create a bite jump in both vertical and horizontal directions (Fig 13a-20). Throughout this book, we have advised against using virtual bite jumps for three key reasons:  \n  252\nFig 13a-18 Submit changes\nFig 13a-19 Model tilt, cant and rotation",

DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW1.Unrealistic Simulations: Virtual bite jumps are not based on rotation around a hinge axis, like the temporomandibular joint in an articulator. 2.Muscular Adaptation: Such adaptations in adult patients are rare and, if they occur, carry a high risk of functional complications. 3.Growth Adaptation: This phenomenon only occurs in children, whereas this book focuses on adult orthodontics. In our experience working with doctors worldwide, we often find that those using bite jumps are misled by visually appealing computer simulations that usually differ significantly from clinical outcomes, especially in adult patients. Even experienced orthodontists can be deceived by this feature.  We believe it is more effective to visualise the changes mentally during the virtual planning phase and anticipate the need for revisions during treatment to refine the bite as you observe the actual clinical changes.  Arch edit (Fig 13a-21) When using DoctorEdit, planning an arch expansion by adjusting one tooth at a time can be tedious and challenging. The arch edit feature simplifies this process by allowing you to move multiple teeth simultaneously. Note: While the computer screen may make everything seem possible, it's important to remember that real-life results can differ significantly due to biological limitations. \n  253\nFig 13a-20 Bite jump\nFig 13a-21 Arche form editing\n13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - SURE SMILESURESMILE  \nIn the SureSmile software, you have access to a wide range of features designed to help you thoroughly review the treatment setup, ensuring that the virtual plan aligns with your expectations and treatment goals. The availability and location of these features can vary slightly depending on whether you're using the aligner software or the ortho software. In this section, we'll focus exclusively on the aligner software. To access the tools for reviewing the setup, click on the star icon in the upper left corner. Start by using the “superimpose” function to compare the initial situation with the proposed final result in a single view (Fig 13b-1). In this view, the teal blue teeth represent the initial positions, while the white teeth represent the planned end result at the conclusion of treatment (the \"R\" stage of the timeline). By comparing these two sets of teeth, you can assess the extent and direction of the planned tooth movements. Next, bring up the clinical photos to evaluate whether the planned tooth movements in the digital setup are realistic and within clinical limits. It's crucial to compare the virtual plan with the actual photos, paying particular attention to the bite and the biotype. Especially in the anterior regions of both the maxilla and mandible, as well as in the posterior areas the biotype should be taken into consideration when the digital planning is performed. In cases with a thin biotype, where the root contours are visible through the gingiva, you should be especially cautious about planning any buccal translation of the teeth. Excessive buccal movement can lead to buccal bone loss and associated gingival recession. Please note that even with a moderate or thick biotype, there are still limits to how much the tooth position can be changed. \n  254\nFig 13b-2 Normal to thick biotype\nFig 13b-1 superimpose\n13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - SURE SMILE\nIf the biotype is considered too thin, an alternative to buccal translation is to plan for a controlled buccal crown tipping. While this approach still carries a risk of gingival recession, the tissue loss is usually confined to the most coronal part of the bone and gingiva. Depending on the current inclination of the teeth, you may also consider adding some lingual root torque to further control the movement and minimise risks (Fig 13b-2). Next step:  Activate occlusal marks. (Fig 13b-3). Now check the occlusion at the end of the treatment. As to our clinical preferences, we prefer not to have any occlusal contacts on the incisors. In addition, we like to have the occlusal contacts evenly spread from the canines on all poster teeth. In patients with a deep bite, we plan the posterior occlusion to be heavy.   Posterior extrusion is rarely expressed clinically as it appears in the virtual treatment plan. In part, it is difficult to achieve posterior extrusion due to the occlusal forces. Secondly, the digital setup is not mounted in a virtual articulator.  By embedding the hard occlusion in the digital setup, we can get an idea of where the occlusion can be expected. In combination with our clinical experience, we can visualise the end result ourselves and get a sense of how the plan should be designed to minimise the likelihood of a revision. If a revision becomes necessary, the movements required at this stage will usually be relatively limited. 3. Checking the tooth movements, the velocity, the sequence and staging Step 1.  Bring up the “movement chart” to evaluate the tooth movements by clicking on the treatment details button in the lower right corner (Fig 13b-4). First, check that the movement velocity is not too fast: rotations should not exceed 2°, and intrusion, extrusion, and translation should be no more than 0.2 mm per stage. In the bottom left of the tooth movements chart, you can switch between cumulative and   255\nFig 13b-3  Occlusal marks",

At the last stage of treatment, it may be beneficial to switch to “cumulative” mode. This provides an overview of the total movements for each tooth in a given direction throughout the entire treatment. Understanding how far a tooth is planned to move helps evaluate whether the movement is realistic within the given time frame and for the overall treatment. Step 2 Review all planned movements meticulously, particularly expansions, while considering Newton's third law and anchorage principles. Analyze each movement alongside the forces required to achieve it and the counteracting forces generated. For example, simultaneous expansion on both the left and right sides should be carefully managed to distribute forces evenly across the jaw. If distalisation is part of the treatment plan, ensure it follows the sequential distalisation protocol, commonly known as the 50% protocol. The 50% protocol involves moving the most distal upper molar first. Once this molar has reached 50% of its final position, the next molar begins its movement. This sequence continues, with each subsequent tooth starting its movement only after the preceding tooth has reached its intended position. As you plan these movements, consider the necessary anchorage strategies, which may include auxiliaries like Temporary Anchorage Devices (TADs) or Class II elastics. These strategies are often not included by clear aligner technicians in the virtual setup, so it is the responsibility of the treating doctor to apply them appropriately. Once the movement pattern is established, determine the appropriate type of anchorage for the case. Incorporate TADs, Class II elastics, or other options as needed, and ensure that any required cutouts are accurately placed in the setup. These cutouts should appear only on the aligners where and when they are needed. For example, in cases involving Class II division 2, simultaneous distalisation with proclination can help achieve the desired alignment of the upper front teeth. However, attaching Class II elastics to a slit or hook in the aligner may exert a downward and distal force on the anterior teeth, counteracting the intended proclination.   256\nFig 13b-5 Treatment details Tooth movements\nFig 13b-4 Treatment details",

      "text": "13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - SURE SMILEAlways keep Newton's third law in mind to ensure that none of the movements contradict each other. For example, attempting to intrude a maxillary canine while applying Class II elastics will result in an extrusive force on the canine, hindering the desired intrusion or, worse, causing extrusion of the tooth instead. When planning cutouts for buttons bonded to teeth or slits in the aligner that act as hooks, consider their respective advantages and disadvantages. We advise against attempting bodily movements on mandibular molars, as these often result in crown tipping rather than true root movement. However, if you choose this advanced approach, proper mesial or distal movement of mandibular molars typically requires the use of auxiliaries, such as TADs and/or power arms. For teeth requiring significant movements, like extensive rotation or extrusion, it is critical to plan the treatment in stages to enhance predictability. For instance, you might first plan the rotation using a vertical engager, followed by extrusion with a horizontal engager. This staged approach simplifies movements and significantly increases predictability. While staging movements improves clinical predictability, it also extends the overall treatment duration, as more stages and aligners are necessary. However, treatments using continuous light forces tend to be more effective clinically, often resulting in fewer revisions and additional aligners. By carefully staging movements and applying light forces, the treatment outcome becomes more predictable and reliable. Although this staged approach initially lengthens treatment time due to the increased number of aligners, it helps avoid potential tracking issues that can arise when multiple complex movements are combined. If tracking issues occur, they can further extend treatment time and increase chair time, potentially making the treatment longer than if a staged approach had been used from the start. 4. Modifying the treatment setup There are two ways the treatment setup can be modified.  1.Changing the end result of the treatment setup. (Send written instructions to tech and/or use the 3D controls) 2.Changing the sequence, staging and velocity of the movements. Add engagers, bite ramps and cutouts. (Send written instructions to tech) Change the end result of the treatment setup. The 3D controls allow the user to individually move each tooth to the desired end position. Once the final setup of the teeth is satisfactory, it is sent to the SureSmile technicians, who will finalise the treatment plan and return it for further review. This process repeats with every correction made by the technicians, as is the case with any other clear aligner system. Change the sequence, staging and velocity of the movements If adjustments to the staging sequence or the velocity of the movements are necessary, a written comment to the technicians is required. Likewise, if changes to the final outcome are needed, you can provide instructions to the SureSmile technicians. This can be done by entering a written note in the comments box (Fig 13b-6).   257",

      "text": "13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - SURE SMILE\nCommunicating with aligner technicians When communicating instructions to the technicians, it is recommended to use bullet points for clarity. Bullet points provide a clear overview of the desired changes, which the technicians can tick off as they address each point. Each bullet point should be very specific. A comment to the technician may appear as follows: Dear tech. Please apply the following instructions.  1.Do not rotate more than 2° per stage. 2.Do not translate, intrude or extrude more than 0.2 mm per stage. Thank you. When communicating with the clear aligner technician, expect to receive exactly what you request. This is why specificity is crucial. For instance, if you ask for “better alignment,” what exactly do you mean? We've encountered numerous vague requests that only lead to confusion, such as: -Align maxillary teeth better (how?) -Rotate less (Which teeth? How much do you want to rotate?) -Use less IPR (Where? Then do what instead?) -Improve midline (How?) As these examples illustrate, technicians will struggle if you don't provide very specific instructions. Across all aligner companies, technicians aim to follow your requests to the best of their abilities. However, broad or vague requests often result in outcomes that don't meet your expectations, as the technician must interpret the request on their own. Since aligner technicians rarely have a dental background and are not orthodontists, they lack the specialised knowledge to think like an orthodontist or general dentist. 3D Control To begin editing tooth movements, first click on “Request Modifications” and then double-click on the tooth you wish to adjust (Fig 13b-7). Once you've selected the tooth, you can modify its position using the errors displayed on the box surrounding the tooth. If the tooth movement table is open, you can also adjust the tooth’s position by clicking on the numbers and changing them. Movements are adjusted in increments of 0.1 mm translation or 1 degree per click. IPR (Interproximal Reduction) adjustments can be made in two ways: 1.Direct Tooth Movement: Move the teeth in a mesial/distal or lingual/buccal direction using the arrows on the box surrounding the tooth (Fig 13b-7). This will affect how the approximal contacts are adjusted. You will see changes in spacing or intersection values in the tooth movement table as a result. 2.Adjusting IPR Values: Click the -/+ buttons in the tooth movement table to modify the intersection or spacing values directly. Keep in mind that this method may cause other teeth to shift. If you prefer to avoid unintended movements, adjust IPR by moving the teeth in the desired direction instead.   258\nFig 13b-6 Request modifications\n13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - SURE SMILE\nWhen changing IPR values in the SureSmile software, remember to account for the IPR values already present in the digital setup. The editing mode does not automatically update the overall treatment values. To check the existing IPR values, hover over one of the symbols above the timeline (yellow triangle, blue square, or grey cross), or view the IPR values directly on the models at any active stage in the timeline. C-Chain Clinically cases with a lot of IPR sometimes end up with residual spaces, or contact points considered too loose. The way to solve this is by adding virtual c-chain stages to the treatment. Virtual c-chain stages work by tightening the contact point by adding lingual translation to the anterior teeth from canine to canine. It is possible to ask for custom modifications to the c-chain stages. The c-chain stages are shown in the timeline as a larger grey with an o in the middle (overcorrection aligners). The legend shows and explains the different characteristics the timeline can have (Fig 13b-8).  When a c-chain has been planned, but tight contacts are already present clinically before using the c-chain stages, it is not necessary to use those aligners. Using c-chain aligners in this situation could risk inducing crowding. To correct this clinical mistake, you can revert to the previous aligner, effectively returning the treatment to an earlier stage. Attachments Changing or removing attachments in the SureSmile software is relatively straightforward. Here’s how to manage attachments effectively: 1.Viewing and Adjusting Attachments: •Navigate to the last stage before the R (editing) stage, where attachments will be visible (Fig 13b-9). •To alter an attachment, click on it to select it.

You can also change the type and size of the attachment or remove it altogether. 2.Adding Attachments: •If you need to add an attachment, specify this in the comments to the technician.

You can also modify the direction or angulation to better direct the forces of the aligner, which is useful for complex movements. For example, an attachment positioned diagonally might assist with both extrusion and rotation. •Beveled Attachments:  Attachments with a bevel are available, but their clinical benefits are mostly theoretical rather than proven. 4.Button Cutouts and Hooks: •If you need to add button cutouts or hooks to the aligners, include this request in your notes to the technician. Cutouts for buttons can be placed on any selected tooth. •Remember that buttons themselves are not included with the aligners and must be ordered separately.

DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - SURE SMILEBy following these steps and clearly communicating your needs, you can eﬀectively manage the attachments and ensure that the aligner treatment plan is optimised for the desired results. Bite ramps Bite ramps can be strategically placed on the palatal surface of the maxillary anterior teeth, ranging from canine to canine. You have the option to position bite ramps exclusively on the incisors, canines, or on all anterior teeth. Additionally, if a bite ramp on a specific tooth is deemed ineffective or if a tooth is too delicate to withstand pressure during orthodontic treatment, it can be removed. Communicate your preferences to the technician to ensure the bite ramps are placed according to your treatment plan. Anterior bite ramps serve two primary purposes: 1.Facilitating Crossbite Treatment: Bite ramps can elevate the bite to ease the correction of a crossbite, allowing the affected teeth to transition more smoothly to their final position. 2.Enhancing Posterior Extrusion: When anterior intrusion is needed alongside posterior extrusion, bite ramps can help by reducing occlusal contact on the posterior teeth. This reduction in contact can potentially increase the likelihood of achieving the planned posterior extrusion.  Note, however, that while bite ramps may aid in achieving initial movement, the long-term stability of extruded posterior teeth may be influenced more by muscle forces than by the teeth themselves. Effective communication with your technician is crucial to ensure that the placement and removal of bite ramps align with your treatment objectives. 5.

If on the other hand, you are happy with the setup as it is you can approve and order aligners (Fig 13b-10).

DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - INVISALIGNINVISALIGN  In the Invisalign software, you have access to a wide range of features designed to help you thoroughly review the ClinCheck (treatment setup), ensuring that the virtual plan aligns with your expectations and treatment goals (Fig 13c-1). The availability and location of these features can vary slightly depending on whether you're using the Invisalign comprehensive or iGo software. In this section, we'll focus exclusively on the Invisalign comprehensive software. In both software, you will find them in the toolbar at the top of the screen. Start by using the “super” function to compare the initial situation with the proposed final result in a single view (you find the super button more or less in the middle of the top toolbar). In this view, the dark blue teeth represent the initial positions, while the white teeth represent the planned end result at the conclusion of treatment (Fig 13b-2). By comparing these two sets of teeth, you can assess the extent and direction of the planned tooth movements. At the beginning of the timeline, you also see a blue square. If you drag the square to a later stage you will see that the blue tent changes the position the the position that the teeth will have on that stage. In that way, you are also able to compare the movement from any given stage to the later given stages to see how far the teeth have moved. Next, bring up the clinical photos to evaluate whether the planned tooth movements in the digital setup are realistic and within clinical limits. (The RECs button in the left corner of the toolbar) It’s crucial to compare the virtual plan with the actual photos, paying particular attention to the biotype, especially in the anterior regions of both the maxilla and mandible, as well as in the posterior areas. In cases with a thin biotype, where the root contours are visible through the gingiva, you should be especially cautious about planning any buccal translation of the teeth. Excessive buccal movement can lead to buccal bone loss and associated gingival recession. If the biotype is considered too thin, an alternative to buccal translation is to plan for a controlled buccal crown tipping. While this approach still carries a risk of gingival recession, the tissue loss is usually confined to the most coronal part of the bone and gingiva.

Analyse each movement in relation to the forces required to achieve it, as well as the counteracting forces generated.

These cutouts should appear only on the aligners when and where they are needed. For example, in cases involving Class II division 2, simultaneous distalisation with proclination can help achieve the desired alignment of the upper front teeth. However, attaching Class II elastics to a slit or hook in the aligner may exert a downward and distal force on the anterior teeth, counteracting the intended proclination. Always consider Newton's third law to ensure that none of the movements contradict each other. For example, attempting to intrude a maxillary canine while applying Class II elastics will result in an extrusive force on the canine, hindering the desired intrusion or, worse, causing extrusion instead. When planning cutouts for buttons bonded to teeth or hooks in the aligner, it is essential to weigh their respective advantages and disadvantages. We advise against attempting bodily movements on mandibular molars, as these often lead to crown tipping rather than true root movement. However, if you choose to proceed with this advanced approach, achieving proper mesial or distal movement of mandibular molars typically requires auxiliaries such as TADs and/or power arms. For teeth requiring significant movements, such as extensive rotation or extrusion, it is critical to plan the treatment in stages to enhance predictability. For instance, you might first plan the rotation using a vertical engager, followed by extrusion with a horizontal engager.

      "text": "13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - INVISALIGNWhile staging movements improves clinical predictability, it also extends the overall treatment duration, as more stages and aligners are needed. However, treatments using continuous light forces tend to be more effective clinically, often resulting in fewer revisions and additional aligners. By carefully staging movements and applying light forces to ensure they are as effective and predictable as possible, the treatment outcome becomes more reliable. Although this staged approach initially lengthens the treatment duration due to the increased number of aligners, it helps avoid potential tracking issues that can arise when multiple complex movements are combined. If tracking issues occur, they can extend the total treatment time and increase chair time, potentially making the treatment longer than if a staged approach had been used from the beginning. 4. Modifying the treatment setup There are two ways the treatment setup can be modified.  1.Changing the end result of the treatment setup. (Send written instructions to tech and/or use the 3D controls) 2.Changing the sequence, staging and velocity of the movements. Add engagers, bite ramps and cutouts.(Send written instructions to tech) Change the end result of the treatment setup The 3D controls allow the user to individually move each tooth to the desired end position. Once the final setup of the teeth is satisfactory, it is sent to the SureSmile technicians, who will finalise the treatment plan and return it for further review. This process repeats with every correction made by the technicians, as is the case with any other clear aligner system. Change the sequence, staging and velocity of the movements If adjustments to the staging sequence or the velocity of the movements are necessary, a written comment to the technicians is required. Likewise, if changes to the final outcome are needed, you can provide instructions to the Invisalign technicians. This can be done by entering a written note in the comments box (Fig 13c-6). Communicating with aligner technicians When communicating instructions to the technicians, it is recommended to use bullet points for clarity. Bullet points provide a clear overview of the desired changes, which the technicians can tick off as they address each point. Each bullet point should be very specific. A comment to the technician may appear as follows: Dear tech. Please apply the following instructions.  1.Do not rotate more than 2° per stage. 2.Do not translate, intrude or extrude more than 0.2 mm per stage. Thank you.   265\nFig 13c-6 Request modifications\n13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - INVISALIGNWhen communicating with a clear aligner technician, you will receive exactly what you request, making specificity essential. For example, if you ask for “better alignment,” what do you specifically mean? Vague requests like the following only create confusion: •Align maxillary teeth better (How?) •Rotate less (Which teeth? By how much?) •Use less IPR (Where? And what should be done instead?) •Improve midline (In what way?) As these examples show, technicians will struggle without clear, precise instructions. Technicians across all aligner companies aim to follow your requests as accurately as possible, but broad or unclear directions often result in outcomes that don’t meet your expectations, as the technician has to interpret the request on their own. Since aligner technicians rarely have a dental background and are not orthodontists, they do not have the specialised knowledge to think like an orthodontist or general dentist. 3D Control To begin editing tooth movements, first click on “Modify plan” and then double-click on the tooth you wish to adjust (Fig 15c-7). After selecting the tooth, you can modify its position using the arrows displayed on the tooth in the chosen direction from the menu on the right side. You can also adjust the tooth's position by clicking on the arrows next to the number representing the desired direction in the menu. Movements are adjusted in increments of 0.1 mm for translation or 1 degree per click. IPR (Interproximal Reduction) Adjustments can be made in two ways: 1.Direct Tooth Movement: Move the teeth in a mesial/distal or lingual/buccal direction using the arrows in the menu (Fig 13c-7). This will affect how the approximal contacts are adjusted. Be aware that the shrouding teeth might move. 2.Adjusting IPR Values: Click the <> buttons between the teeth to modify the IPR or spacing values directly. Keep in mind that this method may cause other teeth to shift. When changing one tooth position in the Invisalign software, the other teeth will automatically adapt to the new position. If you do not what the teeth to move you right click on the tooth you do not want to move and lock the tooth position. You do the same if the Invisalign technician has move a toot that you do not want to move at all. You make the toot unmovable. C-Chain Clinically, cases with extensive IPR can sometimes result in residual spaces or overly loose contact points. To address this, virtual c-chain stages can be added to the treatment. These stages work by tightening contact points through lingual translation of the anterior teeth from canine to canine. Custom modifications to the c-chain stages can also be requested.

If c-chain stages have been planned but good approximal contacts are already present clinically, it is not necessary to use those aligners, as doing so may increase the risk of creating crowding. To correct this type of clinical mistake, you can revert to the previous aligner, effectively returning the treatment to an earlier stage. Attachments Changing or removing attachments in the Invisalign software is relatively straightforward.  You open the toolbar with the attachments and features by clicking on the button above the comments in the right of the screen (Fig 13c-9). There are different attachments to choose from. Types of Attachments: •Vertical vs. Horizontal Attachments:  Choose between vertical and horizontal attachments based on the movement required. •Customising Attachments:  Adjust the length and exact position of the attachment on the tooth. You can also modify the direction or angulation to better direct the forces of the aligner, which is useful for complex movements. For example, an attachment positioned diagonally might assist with both extrusion and rotation. •Beveled Attachments:  Attachments with a bevel are available, but their clinical benefits are mostly theoretical rather than proven. •The 6 angle is an optimised attachment that you can choose to add to a tooth. Invisalign has different optimised attachments depending on the movements they think would be most useful.   To place an attachment on a tooth you drag and drop the attachment from the toolbar to the tooth. Button Cutouts and Hooks: If you need to add button cutouts or hooks to the aligners, you can include this request in your notes to the technician. Or you can drag and drop the slack for a hook and the reverse U for a button cutout. Remember that the buttons themselves are not included with the aligners and must be ordered separately. You can use either metal or plastic buttons, as long as they fit the cutouts. By following these steps and clearly communicating your needs, you can effectively manage the attachments and ensure that the aligner treatment plan is optimised for the desired results.   267\nFig 13c-8 Time line \nFig 13c-9 Attachments",

You have the option to position bite ramps exclusively on the incisors, canines, or on all anterior teeth. Additionally, if a bite ramp on a specific tooth is deemed ineffective or if a tooth is too delicate to withstand pressure during orthodontic treatment, it can be removed. Communicate your preferences to the technician to ensure the bite ramps are placed according to your treatment plan. Anterior bite ramps serve two primary purposes: 1.Facilitating Crossbite Treatment: Bite ramps can elevate the bite to ease the correction of a crossbite, allowing the affected teeth to transition more smoothly to their final position. 2.Enhancing Posterior Extrusion: When anterior intrusion is needed alongside posterior extrusion, bite ramps can help by reducing occlusal contact on the posterior teeth. This reduction in contact can potentially increase the likelihood of achieving the planned posterior extrusion.  Note, however, that while bite ramps may aid in achieving initial movement, the long-term stability of extruded posterior teeth may be influenced more by muscle forces than by the teeth themselves. Effective communication with your technician is crucial to ensure that the placement and removal of bite ramps align with your treatment objectives. 5. Submit the changes to the setup or approve the setup Once you have finished modifying the virtual treatment plan, click the “Submit” button. If you are satisfied with the setup as it is, you can approve and order the aligners (Fig 13c-10). There are two ways to implement your 3D modifications: you can either submit them, as mentioned above, or use the \"Live Update\" feature. After clicking “Live Update,” wait a few minutes to receive the new ClinCheck. Review the updated plan to confirm any changes to attachments, ensure the sequence of movements aligns with your expectations, and verify that the number of passive, active, and c-chain stages is as desired. As you can see, the Invisalign software offers many other tools to assist in virtual treatment planning. We have highlighted only the most commonly used ones. \n  268\nFig 13c-10 “live update”, submit or approve\n13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - SPARKSPARK Spark Approver is the desktop version of the software, offering more tools for working with your setup. We prefer the desktop version because the web version has a limited number of features, although regular updates are made to improve its functionality. Start by using the “Superimpose” function to compare the initial situation with the proposed final result in a single view. You can find the \"Super\" button near the middle of the top toolbar. In this view, the teal blue teeth represent the initial positions, while the white teeth show the planned end result at the conclusion of treatment (Fig 13d-1). By comparing these two sets of teeth, you can assess the extent and direction of the planned movements. At the beginning of the timeline, there is a teal blue square. If you drag the square to a later stage, the blue teeth will change position to reflect their expected location at that stage, allowing you to compare movements from any given stage to later stages to see how far the teeth have moved.  Next, bring up the clinical photos to evaluate whether the planned movements in the digital setup are realistic and within clinical limits. You can find the button for this in the left toolbar of the screen. It is essential to compare the virtual plan with actual photos, focusing particularly on the biotype, especially in the anterior regions of both the maxilla and mandible, as well as the posterior areas (Fig 13d-2). In cases with a thin biotype, where the root contours are visible through the gingiva, be especially cautious when planning any buccal translation of the teeth. Excessive buccal movement can lead to buccal bone loss and gingival recession. If the biotype is considered too thin, an alternative to buccal translation is to plan for controlled buccal crown tipping. While this approach still carries some risk of gingival recession, the tissue loss is usually limited to the most coronal part of the bone and gingiva. Depending on the current inclination of the teeth, you might also consider adding lingual root torque to better control the movement and minimise risks.  \n  269\nFig 13d-2 normal to thick biotype \nFig 13d-1 superimpose",

      "text": "13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - SPARK Next step: Activate occlusal marks (Fig 13d-3). Now check the occlusion at the end of the treatment. As to our clinical preferences, we prefer not to have any occlusal contacts on the incisors. In addition, we like to have the occlusal contacts evenly spread from the canines on all poster teeth. In patients with a deep bite, we plan the posterior occlusion to be heavy. Posterior extrusion is rarely expressed clinically as it appears in the virtual treatment plan. In part, it is difficult to achieve posterior extrusion due to the occlusal forces. Secondly, the digital setup is not mounted in a virtual articulator. By embedding the hard occlusion in the digital setup, we can get an idea of where the occlusion can be expected. In combination with our clinical experience, we can visualise the end result ourselves and get a sense of how the plan should be designed to minimise the likelihood of a revision. If a revision becomes necessary, the movements required at this stage will usually be relatively limited. 3. Checking the tooth movements, the velocity, the sequence and staging Step 1 Bring out the tooth movement table to evaluate the tooth movements. On the right side toolbar, you click on the tooth and get out the tooth movement table. Spark only provides the option to view accumulated movements in the movement table (Fig 13d-4) from the beginning up to the current stage displayed in the setup. The standard tooth movement velocities for Spark resemble those of Invisalign: Maximum translation of 0.25 mm per aligner, including intrusion and extrusion, a maximum of 2 degrees of rotation per aligner, and a maximum of 1 degree of inclination or angulation per aligner. The red and yellow boxes around certain numbers indicate the predictability of specific tooth movements. You can find the threshold setting by clicking the \"Threshold\" button located just above the table. Step 2 Review all planned movements meticulously, particularly expansions, while keeping Newton's third law and anchorage principles in mind. Analyse each movement alongside the forces required to achieve them, as well as the counteracting forces generated. For example, simultaneous expansion on both the left and right sides should be carefully executed to distribute forces evenly across the jaw. If distalisation is part of the treatment plan, ensure that it follows the 270 Fig 13d-3 Occlusal marks 13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - SPARK sequential distalisation protocol, commonly known as the 50% protocol. The 50% protocol involves moving the most distal upper molar first. Once this molar has progressed 50% toward its final position, the next molar begins its movement. This sequence continues, with each subsequent tooth initiating movement only after the preceding tooth has reached its intended position. As you plan these movements, consider the anchorage strategies required. This may include the use of auxiliaries such as Temporary Anchorage Devices (TADs) or Class II elastics to make the virtual plan both realistic and predictable. These anchorage strategies are often not included by clear aligner technicians in the virtual setup, so it is the responsibility of the treating doctor to apply them appropriately. Once the movement pattern is established, evaluate the necessary anchorage type for the specific case. Incorporate TADs, Class II elastics, or other options as needed, and ensure that any required cutouts are accurately placed in the setup. These cutouts should appear only on the aligners where and when they are needed. For instance, in cases involving Class II division 2, simultaneous distalisation with proclination can help in achieving the desired alignment of the upper front teeth. However, attaching Class II elastics to a slit or hook in the aligner may exert a downward and distal force on the anterior teeth, counteracting the intended proclination. Always consider Newton's third law, ensuring that none of the movements contradict each other. For example, attempting to intrude a maxillary canine while applying Class II elastics will result in extrusion forced applied to the canine, hindering the desired intrusion or even worse resulting in the extrusion of the tooth instead. When planning cutouts for buttons bonded to teeth or slits in the aligner that act as hooks, it’s essential to weigh their respective advantages and disadvantages. We advise against attempting bodily movements on mandibular molars, as these often lead to crown tipping rather than true root movement. However, if you choose to proceed with this advanced approach, achieving proper mesial or distal movement of mandibular molars typically requires the use of auxiliaries such as Temporary Anchorage Devices (TADs) and/or power arms. For teeth requiring significant movements, such as extensive rotation or extrusion, it is critical to plan the treatment in stages to enhance predictability. For instance, you might first plan the rotation using a vertical engager, followed by extrusion with a 271 Fig 13d-4 Tooth movement table 13. DIGITAL SETUP REVIEW - SPARKhorizontal engager. This approach simplifies the movements and significantly increases their predictability. While staging movements do improve clinical predictability, they also extend the overall treatment duration, as more stages and aligners are necessary. However, treatments utilising continuous light forces tend to be more effective clinically, often resulting in fewer revisions and fewer additional aligners. By carefully staging the movements and applying light forces to ensure they are as effective and predictable as possible, the treatment outcome becomes more reliable. Although this staged approach initially leads to a longer treatment duration due to the increased number of aligners, it helps avoid potential tracking issues that can arise when multiple complex movements are combined. If tracking issues occur, they can extend the total treatment time and increase chair time, potentially making the treatment longer than if a staged approach had been used from the outset. 4.

How much do you want to rotate?) -Use less IPR (Where? Then do what instead?) -Improve midline (How?)

Across all aligner companies, technicians aim to follow your requests to the best of their abilities. However, broad or vague requests often result in outcomes that don't meet your expectations, as the technician must interpret the request on their own. Since aligner technicians rarely have a dental background and are not orthodontists, they lack the specialised knowledge to think like an orthodontist or general dentist. 3D Control To begin editing tooth movements, double-click on the tooth you wish to adjust (Fig 13d-6).

ATTACHMENTS/ENGAGERSATTACHMENTS/ENGAGERS When we first set out on our orthodontic journey with clear aligners, we were optimistic about the prospect of a less noticeable treatment. Clear aligners had just begun to gain traction, but their capabilities were quite limited. The aligners could handle only the simplest of movements - primarily tipping the teeth into place. This left us facing the frustrating reality that our more complex dental issues were not being addressed as effectively as we had hoped. As we described earlier In the early stages of our treatment, the lack of attachments meant that our aligners struggled to grasp and guide our teeth with the precision required for more intricate movements. Our expectations clashed with the reality of what the technology could achieve. It was as though we were trying to navigate a winding path with only a straightedge - a straightforward tool for simple problems, but woefully inadequate for the nuanced journey we faced. Then came the introduction of attachments, which were touted as the game-changer for clear aligners. These small, composite knobs, known as attachments, promised to enhance the aligners' ability to move teeth in various directions with greater control and predictability. The anticipation was high; we believed these attachments would be the key to overcoming the limitations we had experienced. However, our initial enthusiasm was met with unexpected challenges. The early days of using attachments brought their own set of complications. Clear aligner companies offered horizontal and vertical attachments, and some even introduced special designs. Yet, despite their promises, these special designs lacked robust scientific backing. They were intended for specific movements but often proved difficult to work with, introducing their own set of problems. If an attachment was lost or misplaced, recreating and repositioning it required a new template, adding layers of complexity to our treatment. We soon realised that the use of attachments wasn't as straightforward as we had hoped. Aligners operate on pushing forces, while traditional braces leverage both pushing and pulling forces. This fundamental difference meant that mastering the application of attachments required a shift in our understanding of how to achieve the desired tooth movements. The variety in attachment types - whether horizontal for intrusions or extrusions, or vertical for rotations and translations - required careful consideration and strategic planning. Our journey continued as we experimented with the orientation of attachments, sometimes placing them at angles to better align with the tooth movements. Some practitioners also explored bevelled designs to increase surface interaction with the aligner. Yet, these innovations were more theoretical than proven, with little scientific evidence to confirm their superiority over standard designs. One of the most significant revelations in our experience was the importance of staging. Staging the treatment process - addressing horizontal movements before tackling vertical ones, or vice versa - emerged as a key strategy for improving predictability and outcomes. This method allowed us to focus on one type of movement at a time, 280 14. ATTACHMENTS/ENGAGERSreducing the complexity and increasing the effectiveness of each stage. Despite these advancements, patient requests posed their own challenges. Some patients were reluctant to have attachments placed on their anterior teeth, which meant we had to carefully weigh their preferences against the need for effective treatment. In cases where attachments were avoided, we faced a higher risk of tracking issues and often had to schedule additional revisions or aligners. Reflecting on our journey, it became clear that our early frustrations with attachments were part of a larger learning process. The evolution of attachments in clear aligner therapy has not been without its hurdles, but it has ultimately led to improved outcomes. Our experiences underscored the importance of adhering to proven protocols, such as the 12-step bonding procedure we developed, which significantly reduced attachment failures. For certain tooth movements, it can be challenging for an aligner to securely grasp the teeth and guide them in the intended direction. To address this issue, the use of attachments or engagers becomes necessary to ensure proper grip by the aligners. Many clear aligner companies refer to these composite knobs as attachments, whereas ClearCorrect specifically labels them as engagers. Design Most aligner companies use two main types of attachments: horizontal and vertical. Some companies have developed attachments with special designs, but there is no evidence to support that these designs are superior. In fact, special designs can be more challenging to work with, as they are typically intended for specific movements and may not fit precisely in the space provided by the aligner. Consequently, if an attachment is lost, a special template must be created to ensure the accurate placement of a new attachment whereas standard attachments can be recreated using the aligner itself as a template. The choice of attachment depends on the specific tooth movement required. Generally, when horizontal movements such as intrusions or extrusions are needed, a horizontal attachment is chosen. Conversely, for vertical movements like rotations or translations, vertical attachment are typically preferred. In cases where both types of movement are involved simultaneously, the attachment suited for the more challenging movement is selected. By maximising the size of 281 Fig 14-1 Attachments and forces 14. ATTACHMENTS/ENGAGERSthis attachment, its extended surface aids in facilitating the other movement as well. Some practitioners experiment with the orientation of the attachment, positioning it at an angle to align with the combined direction of the tooth's movement (Fig. 14-1). Additionally, a feature allows practitioners to choose a beveled attachment design, which is believed to increase the surface area that the attachment interacts with the clear aligner material. In theory, this should enhance the predictability of the attachment's function. However, both the orientation of the attachments and the beveled surface design lack substantial scientific evidence, making them more of an academic consideration than a proven technique. From our clinical experience, it appears that aligner material may slide off beveled attachments more easily. Staging For optimal predictability of tooth movement, staging the process is recommended. Staging involves addressing one type of movement at a time. For example, starting with horizontal movements using horizontal attachments before progressing to vertical movements with vertical attachments, or vice versa depending on the complexity of the case and the clinical circumstances. Patient requests Occasionally, patients express reluctance to have attachments placed on their teeth, particularly on the anterior teeth. While it is possible to initiate some aligner treatments and achieve certain movements clinically without attachments, it significantly heightens the risk of tracking issues. Subsequently, you may opt for a revision with or without attachments based on what was promised to the patient and the remaining movements required for those teeth. However, it's crucial to understand that treating patients without attachments is not suitable for cases with moderate or complex issues. The absence of attachments might be appropriate for patients with easily treatable malocclusions. In such instances, you can proceed treating the patient without attachments on the anterior teeth.",

In such instances, you can proceed treating the patient without attachments on the anterior teeth.\n\nHowever it's our preference to inform this kind of patient that we're willing to attempt treatment without attachments initially, but if we don't achieve all planned movements clinically, attachments will be necessary for the revision. If we are to treat patients with this kind of specific request we make sure to be very clear in our expectations on the patients side. It's essential to carefully consider agreeing to any terms of patients. As the treating doctor, you bear the responsibility for the treatment's outcome. Limiting your treatment options by treating patients without attachments, typically requires more chair time due to the increased need for revisions or additional aligners compared to patients without these restrictions. This contributes to higher treatment expenses, considering the cost of chair time per hour (250 - 400€/hour). This should be taken into consideration prior to presenting a treatment and the associated costs for the patient. It raises the question: Should you agree to treat patients under these conditions? Let us answer that question with another question: Performing a root canal treatment on the first maxillary molar on a patient. Would you agree to only fill 2 out of 4 root canals, if the patient 282 14. ATTACHMENTS/ENGAGERSrequests this? If not - why then let a patient dictate how an orthodontic treatment should be performed? Placing attachments The material used for attachment templates varies among aligner brands. Some companies use a thicker, less flexible material, which can make the template harder to remove after bonding the attachments, especially if the template has a straight trim line. However, this thickness can also enhance the precision of attachment placement. Many practitioners face issues with attachments debonding, and we understand the frustration this causes. We encountered similar challenges when we first began using clear aligners in our dental practice around 2008. This led us to reevaluate our approach to bonding composite materials to tooth surfaces. In retrospect, we realised that we had deviated from the established composite bonding standards we learned in dental school. This wasn’t a deliberate choice, but rather an oversight we discovered while analysing our workflow with our team. If you conduct a similar self-assessment, you might find that you are making the same mistakes we and many of our colleagues have made. By adhering to the bonding procedure outlined below, attachments should remain intact during template removal, unless bonded to porcelain or metal, which requires a different protocol. If an attachment is particularly large and the template is made from a thick, rigid material with a straight trim line, or if the composite material chemically interacts with the template, the attachment may be at risk of breaking during placement. Use a stopwatch We recommend incorporating a stopwatch into your bonding procedure. Even with years of experience, you might be surprised at how slowly 30 seconds can feel while applying acid etch to the enamel or rubbing bonding agent into the dentin. Years ago, we came across a study about etching and bonding times in dental offices. The study revealed that, on average, dentists spend only 12 seconds on procedures that are intended to take 30 seconds, such as enamel etching and dentin bonding. Despite believing we were dedicating enough time to each step, using a stopwatch revealed that we were not. Encouraging many colleagues to use a stopwatch has often led to adjustments in their bonding techniques and significantly improved treatment outcomes. This realisation might simply be a part of human nature, particularly in the fast-paced environment of a dental surgery. Workflow Improvements Our team thoroughly analysed our entire workflow and began enhancing each component to achieve better clinical outcomes and reduce the costly chair time spent on reworks. It's crucial to emphasise that the workflow must be simple and efficient. If it becomes too cumbersome, time-consuming, or overly academic in design, it's likely to fail in 98% of surgeries. Below, we outline a workflow that we've found to work seamlessly in almost any surgery, whether 283 14. ATTACHMENTS/ENGAGERSit's the dentist or a team member performing the attachment bonding procedure. 12 step attachment/engager bonding protocol 1.Place a Drytip in each cheek. 2.Place an Ivoclar Optragate on top of the Drytips for isolation and easier mounting of attachments. 3.Sandblast all enamel surfaces to be bonded for 1-2 seconds as this will remove aprismatic enamel and increase the bond strength dramatically. 4.Acid etch the enamel for 30-60 seconds with 30% phosphoric acid (use a stopwatch!) 5.Rinse with plenty of water and dry the surface completely until the surface turns matt white (Remember it is enamel - not dentin) 6.DO NOT allow moisture to reach the enamel at any point during the procedure after the acid has been rinsed away until the attachment or engager has been placed and light cured. 7.The bonding agent is applied for 3 seconds. 8.Fill the indentations in the template with a compost material with a high filler content. It's easier to manage to avoid excess and will not wear as fast. Whether you choose a flowable or regular composite does not really matter. Just think about the treatment time of the aligner treatment. The longer the treatment time (>25 aligners) the more wear you will see on the attachments over time. However, with longer treatment times you will most likely have to make revisions/ additional aligners anyway. Which means you will have to place new attachments. 9.Insert the template and seat it perfectly onto the teeth. 10.Keep the template in place while light curing every attachment for at least 4 seconds. (Depending on the curing light you have in your practice) 11.Use a sturdy instrument to \"pop off\" the template from the composite before gently removing the template starting on the facial surface in the most posterior area. If you use a thick template material with a straight trim line it can be easier to start removing the template from the palatal side on one of the most posterior teeth. 12.Inspect the template for any remnants of composite every time you use a different type of composite (some types of composite may bond chemically to the template) Over the years, we've provided guidance to several practices struggling with attachments falling off. Once they began adhering to this protocol, their issues ceased. In our own practice, we've never experienced a single instance of attachment or engager loss while using this exact protocol for five years. This underscores the importance of adhering strictly to a protocol rather than relying solely on the dentist's skill. When attachments are lost, 99% of the time it's attributable to deviations from the recommended bonding protocols or contamination of the enamel or bonding material with blood, saliva or the like. Even when placing attachments on porcelain, they can be secured in a manner that significantly reduces the likelihood of detachment.",

Some practitioners have experimented with placing vaseline or glycerine inside the template in the past. However, this practice is highly   284\n14. ATTACHMENTS/ENGAGERSdiscouraged due to the risk of even minor vaseline residue affecting the composite's shape, rendering it an unsuitable approach. Nevertheless, certain types of composite may chemically interact with the template material, leading to adhesion. In such cases, we recommend exploring alternative composite options. Drilling holes in the indentations of the templates is unnecessary and ill-advised, especially for attachment bonding. While this technique may be suitable for larger composite restorative templates (e.g. RH crowns), it should never be employed for attachments. Doing so alters the attachments surface's shape, causing misalignment of the aligner and hindering proper tooth movement. Consequently, this may necessitate additional aligner revisions. Mastering Attachments in Clear Aligner Treatment Our journey with attachments in clear aligner therapy has been one of growth and learning. While the initial introduction of attachments presented challenges, we were able to achieve o u r d e s i r e d r e s u l t s t h r o u g h c a r e f u l experimentation and adherence to refined protocols. The evolution of attachments has not been a linear process, but it has ultimately improved our ability to handle complex orthodontic cases more effectively. This experience reflects the broader theme of innovation in orthodontics. As with any emerging technology, the true benefits of attachments come from ongoing learning, adaptation, and the application of best practices. Our experience highlights the importance of balancing new advancements with established techniques to ensure the best outcomes for our patients. Today, we focus on predictability and simplicity - strategies that have consistently yielded reliable results - rather than pursuing novel features without robust scientific support. This approach also simplifies the process, making it easier to delegate the attachment bonding protocol to our team members. 285\n14. ATTACHMENTS/ENGAGERSChecklist for attachments: 1.Evaluate patient’s needs: ★Identify if simple tipping movements are insufficient and more complex tooth movements are required. ★Assess whether attachments are needed to assist with specific movements such as rotations, extrusions, and intrusions. ★Consider the patient’s request, especially if they express reluctance toward anterior attachments. 2.Determine appropriate attachment design: ★Horizontal attachments for intrusions/extrusions. ★Vertical attachments for rotations/translations. ★If both movements are involved, choose the attachment that addresses the more difficult movement and consider staging 3.Check surface area and placement: ★Maximise attachment size for better interaction with the aligner. ★Consider attachment design (angled, beveled) when needed, but be cautious due to limited scientific support. Actionable tips for optimising attachments in treatment planning: 1.Understand the limitations: ★Aligners push teeth but cannot pull like traditional braces; therefore, attachments are essential to guide more complex movements. ★Be aware that special designs might not have substantial evidence to support their superiority over traditional attachments. 2.Use staging strategically: ★Address one movement type at a time for optimal predictability. ★Staging simplifies treatment and reduces the risk of complications during each step. 3.Prepare for patient requests: ★If a patient requests no attachments on the anterior teeth, explain the increased risk of tracking issues. ★Set clear expectations, letting the patient know attachments may be required later if the treatment isn’t progressing as planned. 286",

IPRIPR General dentists and orthodontists around the world face a common challenge: mastering Interproximal Reduction (IPR) in clear aligner treatments. Imagine a busy practice where a doctor is attempting to create the ideal space for tooth movement, only to encounter the unpredictable and often frustrating realities of IPR. The excitement of incorporating IPR into treatment plans is quickly tempered by concerns over enamel removal, maintaining tooth morphology, and ensuring precise results. Every miscalculation can lead to open bites, potential caries, spaces between teeth, the stress of additional refinements, and ultimately a risk of changing the bite to a degree that needs maxillofacial surgery to be resolved. All casting a shadow over what should be a straightforward procedure. As you read through this chapter, you will uncover the intricacies of IPR and the common hurdles faced by practitioners. Yet, there is a beacon of clarity amidst the confusion. Introducing a streamlined 6-step IPR protocol, we will navigate through the complexities with a systematic approach designed to alleviate these issues. This protocol will transform your clinical IPR process from a source of tension into a model of efficiency and predictability. Moving a tooth with an aligner requires space around the tooth for it to shift into the desired position. One effective method to create this space is through Interproximal Reduction. IPR involves carefully removing a small amount of enamel from between the teeth, thereby creating the necessary room for movement. IPR can be particularly beneficial in various clinical scenarios. For instance, in cases of significant crowding where the biotype is relatively thin, it may not be feasible to procline the teeth sufficiently to straighten the dental arch without risking gum recession. In such instances, IPR can create the required space for tooth movement without compromising the delicate biological structures, ensuring a successful and biologically sound orthodontic treatment. In all clear aligner software and initial digital setups, round tripping is a commonly employed strategy to address crowding swiftly and efficiently. Round tripping involves initially pushing the anterior teeth buccally to facilitate alignment, making it easier to perform IPR while ensuring that the interproximal surfaces are properly aligned and conducive to shaping into a desirable morphology during IPR. After the IPR is completed, the teeth are retracted to the desired end position, closing the spaces created by the IPR. However, if the biotype is thin and there is limited room to procline the teeth, the bone may recede, allowing the teeth to pass through the cortical bone and potentially leading to recession over time. Once the cortical bone is lost, it often does not regenerate. Therefore, it's advisable to perform IPR at an earlier stage, sometimes by staging IPR to mitigate the negative effects of round tripping. Performing IPR at an earlier stage may pose challenges in accurately measuring the correct amount of IPR and maintaining the desired tooth morphology throughout treatment. In such cases, IPR can be planned in stages, allowing the dentist to conduct the procedure at different points during treatment. This approach increases the likelihood 292 15. IPRof the teeth remain within the bone at all times, leading to a more predictable long-term treatment outcome. However, it necessitates more comprehensive planning, additional chair time, and potentially more control visits. Another scenario where IPR may be necessary is in cases with significant overjet. Reducing interproximal tooth substance creates space, and retracting the teeth afterward can help decrease the overjet. In these cases, it is crucial to be cautious about how the aligner technicians plan the treatment. Too often, we see IPR planned for both the mandible and maxilla in Class II patients, which can result in a collapse of the lower face if the plan is followed without modifications. In patients with a Bolton discrepancy, where the patient's teeth are larger than average, reshaping the teeth with IPR can facilitate easier, faster, and more predictable alignment of crowded teeth compared to sequential distalisation. IPR can also be beneficial in patients with a class III malocclusion tendency, an edge-to-edge bite, or an anterior crossbite. If there is primarily contact on the anterior teeth leading to a posterior open bite, IPR between the anterior teeth may help resolve the issue. However, the appropriateness of IPR should always be determined based on the required movements, the amount of bone present and other alternatives, with the clinical situation being the primary consideration during planning. Clinical tip: Fast, easy & predictable IPR This is our preferred approach to IPR for clear aligner patients - a method that ensures the process is fast, easy, and consistently reliable. Step by step 1.Start by using a perforated red metal strip to loosen the contact points - a single pull through the contact point is usually enough. 2.We recommend using Dentatus IPR tips with a Profin PDX or EVA contra-angle hand piece. Dentatus tips are currently the only IPR tips on the market specifically calibrated for clear aligner treatments. They are rigid, resistant to bending during use, and less prone to breakage compared to competing products. 3.Always start using the 0.1 millimetre tip and move upwards tip by tip until the planned amount of IPR has been reached. 4.Use the 0.1 mm. tip or a fine Soflex disc to polish the surfaces at the end. 5.Apply fluoride varnish (Our personal favourite is Fluorprotector S from Ivoclar as it is clear, and does not stick to the aligner and teeth as much as other varnishes. In addition, it has a higher concentration of fluoride once it has dried into the tooth surface) 6.For maximum efficiency, we use each IPR tip for all the intervals required before moving to the next, larger tip. Be sure to monitor when to stop, especially if there are variations in the amount of IPR needed in different interproximal spaces. Dentatus IPR kit The only IPR kit on the market calibrated ideally for the IPR needed in clear aligner treatments (Fig 15-1). Fast and predictable With the method and equipment shown, it is possible for us to achieve 0.3 mm. IPR in 7 different locations in less than 5 minutes. Since the Dentatus tips are calibrated, there is no need to measure the spaces created, making the 293 15. IPR system both fast and predictable to use - once you have mastered it. Morphology The wide plate of the Dentatus IPR tip makes it easy to ensure that the full length of the teeth is properly corrected. So there are no small overhangs or inaccuracies that can prevent the teeth from moving according to the virtual treatment plan. The morphology is not worsened by using a wide tip. Because if you need 0.5 mm. IPR, the teeth will almost always be more square - no matter which IPR system you use. In these instances you just have to adjust the incisal surface of the teeth and maybe round the facial and buccal surface after performing the desired amount of IPR.",

Simply insert the tip perpendicularly into the space between the teeth and pass it up through the approximal space in one sliding motion. (The burr should be running through the entire steadily swiping motion). Risk during IPR We think it is essential to remember that teeth are mobile when IPR is being performed. When the teeth are able to move, it can potentially give an erroneous picture of how much IPR is performed. Using instruments that are not calibrated like the Dentatus IPR kit, you have to constantly measure whether you have achieved the desired amount of IPR. When the measuring instrument is being pressed in between the teeth, the teeth can move, giving an impression that the desired amount of IPR has been performed. When using measuring instruments, it is therefore important to find the balance between pressing the measuring disc between the teeth and letting it slide without resistance. 294\nFig 15-1 Dentatus IPR tips",

IPRChecklist for Performing IPR: 1.Pre-Procedure Planning: ★Identify the need for IPR in cases of crowding, overjet, or Bolton discrepancy. ★Plan IPR staging to avoid over-proclination and maintain bone support. ★Use aligner software to accurately determine where and how much IPR is needed. 2.During IPR: ★Loosen contact points with a perforated strip. ★Use Dentatus IPR tips, starting with 0.1 mm and increasing as needed. ★Polish with Soflex discs and apply fluoride varnish (e.g., Fluorprotector S). Checklist for Special Cases: 1.Overjet Reduction: ★Use IPR to create space, allowing teeth to be retracted and reduce overjet. 2.Bolton Discrepancy/Class III: ★Reshape teeth for faster alignment or reduce anterior contacts to correct bite. Risk Management: 1.Prevent Over-Reduction: ★Be mindful of enamel thickness (0.6 mm on mandibular incisors) to avoid reaching dentin. 2.Check if IPR is actually needed: ★Take a critical look at the digital setup. Sometimes aligner technicians plan IPR in places without indication.  3.Minimise Soft Tissue Damage: ★Use Dentatus tips for safer, back-and-forth motion that avoids soft tissue injury. Fast IPR Protocol: 1.Loosen contact points with a red strip. 2.Start with 0.1 mm Dentatus tip and increase as needed. 3.Polish and apply fluoride varnish. 4.Round surfaces with an American football-shaped burr. By following this streamlined approach, IPR can be performed efficiently and predictably while minimising risks and ensuring treatment success. \n  296\n15. IPR\n  297",

On the long run this reduces the marketing costs per patient, associated with paid advertising. Dr. Harper's Struggle Dr. Harper sat at his desk, staring at the day’s schedule. Another clear aligner patient was coming in for their first set of trays, and he felt the familiar knot of anxiety tightening in his stomach. It had been a rough few months since he started offering clear aligner therapy at his practice. His initial excitement about the new treatment option had quickly faded, replaced by a growing sense of dread as case after case unraveled. Patients weren’t following instructions, aligners weren’t fitting as expected, and tracking issues had become the norm rather than the exception. He knew something was wrong, but he couldn’t quite figure out what. Dr. Harper had always taken pride in his ability to master new techniques and incorporate them into his practice. But this time, nothing seemed to be working. The training sessions he had attended were comprehensive, yet in the daily whirlwind of his practice, the guidelines blurred. The result was a string of unhappy patients and an increasing number of refunds. One particular case still haunted him—a young professional eager to straighten her teeth before her wedding. She was diligent, or so she claimed, but by the fifth set of aligners, nothing was tracking properly. Her teeth seemed to resist every move the aligners attempted. Frustration built up, appointments grew tense, and eventually, she lost faith in both the treatment and in him. The embarrassment still stung. He was quite sure the clear aligners weren’t the issue. The problem lay in the process—the delivery, the follow-ups and the monitoring. His patients weren’t receiving the guidance they needed, and he wasn’t delivering the results they deserved. One evening, after his staff had gone home, Dr. Harper sat alone in his office, searching for answers. That’s when he came across our work. We had developed detailed protocols for clear aligner therapy, from the initial patient consultation to the final set of aligners. With nothing to lose, he decided to reach out to us. Delivery Depending on whether IPR and attachment placement were planned from the start, these procedures need to be addressed during the first appointment. By the time of delivery, patients have often been waiting for their aligners for several weeks and are usually excited to begin. It is important to re-inform the patient about the proper use of aligners: Standard patient information upon delivery: •The aligners should be worn 22 hours a day. •The aligners are to be taken out when eating and drinking anything other than water. 300 16. DELIVERY & FOLLOW UP•Aligners should be rinsed off with cold tap water before reinserting it (as soon as eating or drinking has been finished) •Cleaning the aligners can be done with a manual toothbrush and some toothpaste every time the patient is brushing the teeth anyway. (Minimum twice daily) •The aligners are to be kept away from pets and children. •When the aligners are not in the mouth they are to be stored in the aligner box that is delivered with the aligners. •No aligners should be thrown out after use. Instead, the patient should make sure to keep all of the aligners until the end of the entire treatment •The first aligner is to be used for two weeks. •After two weeks the first aligner is replaced by aligner no. 2 •Aligner no. 1 is cleaned, put in pouch no. 1 and stored in a place outside the reach of kids and pets. •Aligner no. 2 is to be worn for two weeks. •After the initial 4 weeks the patient will have to visit the practice for a clinical control, delivery of the next aligners, placement of attachments or engagers and having IPR done if appropriate at this stage of the treatment. Try in: •Show the patient how the aligners are positioned and removed correctly •Let the patient try it. •Demonstrate how chewies or the like is to be used to ensure the aligners are seated correctly. •In case the patient has challenges removing the aligners. Demonstrate how an Outie or a crochet hook can be used to help remove the aligners. Making it easy for both the patient and you When first wearing aligners, patients may experience some discomfort in their teeth, which is perfectly normal. It often takes practice for patients to properly fit the aligners onto their teeth and remove them, particularly in clinical situations where the direction of insertion is challenging. Adding attachments or engagers during this initial phase can further increase the difficulty of both placing and removing the aligners. Beginning with the first two aligners without attachments makes the process much easier for patients, facilitating both placement and removal. This smoother start enhances the patient experience and reduces the time spent teaching patients how to use the aligners during appointments. Over the first four weeks, patients become accustomed to wearing their aligners. This familiarity eliminates the perception of aligners as unfamiliar or burdensome, making it a lot easier for patients to adapt to more complex daily maintenance once the attachments or engagers are added. Avoiding costly challenges We prefer to postpone any IPR until the third step of the treatment. This delay is aimed at ensuring that the initial appointment is as comfortable and straightforward for the patient as possible, thereby enhancing their overall experience. Additionally, delaying IPR helps mitigate the irreversible removal of enamel from the proximal spaces. If a patient decides to discontinue treatment prematurely, they may be left with noticeable spaces between their teeth due to the IPR, which cannot be reversed by regrowing enamel. Closing these spaces with a restorative solution can be costly and may not be accepted by 301 16. DELIVERY & FOLLOW UPthe patient. Furthermore, as a treating doctor, there may be little interest in performing restorative treatment on a patient who is not fully committed to the treatment plan. Avoiding IPR in the initial stages of aligner treatment does not alter the treatment plan significantly, as noticeable bone remodelling typically does not occur until approximately four weeks into treatment. Delaying IPR and engager bonding until step three allows for better control over patient compliance. This approach significantly enhances the patient experience and spares the dental practice from undertaking time-consuming and potentially challenging procedures for the few patients who may opt out of continuing treatment. Let the Patients Do the Work During the first appointment, begin by showing the patient their first set of aligners in the pouch.

      "text": "Let the Patients Do the Work During the first appointment, begin by showing the patient their first set of aligners in the pouch. Demonstrate how to identify the correct set number and how to open the pouch. Insert and remove the aligners for the patient once, then guide them to chew on a \"chewie\" or similar tool, starting with the molars, followed by the premolars, and finally the canines and incisors. While the aligners are in the patient's mouth, demonstrate how they should look when seated correctly. Instruct the patient to check for any gaps between the aligner and their teeth or attachments. If they notice any fit issues, ask them to take a photo (a selfie is usually sufficient) and send it to the practice. This allows the situation to be reviewed by the doctor or an external expert, enabling corrective measures to be taken, often without the need for the patient to visit the dental office. Educating patients to monitor their own aligners serves two key purposes: 1.Enhanced Commitment and Compliance: When patients are involved in checking their aligners, they are more likely to feel a sense of ownership over their treatment, which generally leads to improved compliance. 2.Cost Reduction: By empowering patients to manage and report their aligner fit, the need for expensive digital measuring devices to track treatment progress is reduced. After demonstrating how the aligners are to be inserted, let the patient practice doing it themselves. If the patient struggles with removing the aligners, demonstrate how to use an \"outie\" tool or a crochet hook to grip the trimline of the aligner at the back of the mouth. Aligners with a scalloped trimline usually come off more easily when pulled from the facial side at the most posterior part. Meanwhile, aligners made of thicker material with a straight trimline may be easier to remove from the oral side, especially after attachments or engagers have been placed. Storage You have probably had experiences with patients wearing other types of oral appliances, that may have had negative experiences from improper storage (e.g., pets chewing the appliance, waitstaff discarding them, children playing with them, flight attendants removing them, or even neighbors trying them on). With clear aligners, proper storage becomes even more important, as they need to be worn for 22 hours a day. Instruct patients to always carry their storage case and to store their aligners in the case when not in use. 302 16. DELIVERY & FOLLOW UPWhen transitioning to the next set of aligners in the treatment plan, the used aligner should be stored in its original pouch. If something happens to the aligner in use, instruct the patient to contact the practice and wear the previous aligner as a replacement until the doctor decides whether to order a replacement, move to the next aligner, or perform a refinement. Cleaning We prefer simple cleaning protocols. Therefore, we instruct patients to clean their aligners with a regular toothbrush and toothpaste (but not an electric toothbrush, as it may cause the toothpaste to splatter). While some practitioners recommend using a non-abrasive soap, we find that using regular toothpaste is sufficient, given that patients typically wear each set of aligners for no more than two weeks. This approach simplifies the cleaning process and provides patients with a sense of cleanliness that aligns with their everyday experience of brushing their teeth. There are also chemical products on the market designed specifically for cleaning clear aligners, such as powders or pellets that dissolve in water, creating a solution in which aligners can be soaked",

While these solutions are effective and safe for the aligners, daily brushing with a toothbrush eliminates the need for these chemicals and reduces the complexity for patients. If there are concerns about hygiene during treatment, aligners can also be used as carriers for fluoride gel at night. Flossing Instruct the patient to floss between all their teeth twice a week, not just for hygienic reasons, but to ensure that no contact points are too tight. Explain that if the contact points are too tight, the teeth will not move as planned. It is important to emphasise that while patients often floss to ensure proper progression of their treatment, they may neglect flossing for hygiene. Regular flossing helps to maintain adequate space for tooth movement and ensures effective treatment. If the contact points are too tight, instruct the patient to visit the practice for adjustment. Typically, a fine-gritted red metal strip is used to address this issue. By gently pulling the strip through the contact point once, the problem is often resolved. Improving patient compliance Taking the time to ensure patients are comfortable with their aligners during the initial appointment can save chair time later on, should the patient forget how to use the aligners properly. This initial training also improves compliance throughout the treatment. After the initial appointment, the patient should leave the practice with the first set of aligners already inserted and the second set in hand. The remaining aligners are kept at the practice. The first two sets of aligners are to be worn for two weeks each. For an enhanced delivery protocol that includes brand-strengthening strategies and their practical applications, scan the QR code to access all the details (QR 16-1). Scheduling the next appointment Before leaving, patients schedule a follow-up visit for a control examination four weeks later, allowing for any necessary IPR and attachment or engager bonding. 303 16. DELIVERY & FOLLOW UPIt's important to note that at the start of orthodontic treatment, bone remodelling does not occur immediately due to pressure on the teeth. It typically takes 3 to 4 weeks for osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and periodontal fibres around the teeth to initiate the remodelling process. Attempting to move teeth too rapidly within this initial period poses a high risk of tracking issues. While there may be some limited movement of the teeth with the first two aligners, it primarily occurs within the periodontal space. Second appointment At the second appointment attachments or engages are placed and IPR is performed, if prescribed in the treatment setup. The second appointment is often a fairly long appointment since it can take some time to do the IPR and place the attachments or engages, especially if the clinical team does not yet have experience with this and IPR is being performed manually without any mechanical tools. Depending on the complexity of the treatment and the planned tooth movements in the next set of aligners, you need to decide whether the patient can wear the next set of aligners for less than two weeks and how many aligners to provide at once. For simpler tooth movements, we typically reduce the wear time to 10 days per set of aligners. In general we avoid reducing the wear time to 7 days initially because we are still assessing the biological response to the treatment and the patient’s compliance. If no tracking issues are observed after the initial 4-6 aligners, the treatment will usually progresses smoothly as planned. Initial tracking issues at the beginning of treatment are most often related to patient compliance.",

If the aligners are not worn consistently, the teeth will not move as expected. This also serves as a way to let the patient know that noncompliance will be evident. If no tracking issues are observed, we provide the patient with the next 4 to 6 aligners and instruct them to wear each set for 10 days (if appropriate). Setting expectations During the initial discussion about clear aligner treatment, patients should be informed that each set of aligners has to be worn for two weeks. If a patient is concerned about the overall treatment duration, it is explained that, with high compliance and no tracking issues, the wear time might be reduced to 10 days per set.

FITTING/TRACKING ISSUES - TROUBLESHOOTINGFITTING/TRACKING ISSUES - TROUBLESHOOTING Tracking issues happen in all types of orthodontic treatments. Treating patients with fixed appliances requires adjustments that most often can be performed while the patient is in the dental office for a control visit. Often times the same is true when treating patients with clear aligners. However, if the tracking issue can not be solved directly, new photos, a new IO scan and a revision of the virtual treatment plan is necessary. In this part, we describe some of the most common challenges related to the fit and tracking of clear aligners. Please note that fitting and tracking issues are something that relate to all types of clear aligners across all brands. Fit issues upon delivery Sometimes the first aligner does not seem to fit perfectly. Before discarding the aligner and ordering new ones, consider the following  There are different reasons an aligner may not fit from the beginning of the treatment. 1.The teeth have moved since the IO scan was made  If the initial intraoral scan was done more than 3 to 4 months prior to the delivery of the first set of aligners. There is a risk the teeth have been moving since the IO scan was made. The teeth are never in a static position. The teeth will always position themselves in a perfect balance between the outer and inner forces of the muscles and soft tissues surrounding them. This makes the position of the teeth in the dental arch highly dynamic. Knowing there is always a little bit of tooth movement. The longer it takes from the initial IO-scan is made to the aligners are being delivered the higher the risk of these kind of fitting issues. 2.Production error On rare occasions, something in the aligner production is not 100% accurate. This can lead to one or more aligners with a bad fit. 3.Path of insertion Sometimes the direction of insertion makes it really difficult to fully seat the aligner on the teeth. In these instances, it can be a great help to let the patient bite the aligners into place with the aid of chewies. First on the molars, then on the incisors. Sometimes, when we support a practice over the phone, we can actually hear the aligner snap into place. This often happens when the team follows the described  approach while communicating with us. Step-by-step troubleshooting 1.If the aligner does not fit. Seat the aligner on the teeth and take one or more photos showing how the aligner does not fit the teeth. 2.Send the photos to the support of your clear aligner provider in combination with a description of the problem related to aligner no. 1. The support team will analyse your information and try to find the reason why the   310\n17. FITTING/TRACKING ISSUES - TROUBLESHOOTINGaligner is not fitting. The support team will typically send a new aligner based on the approved setup. This will rule out any potential manufacturing errors. If this new first aligner still does not fit, a new IO scan should be made and uploaded to the doctor portal. This means the digital planning will have to start all over again. Here it is important to write instructions in the revision form, that the exact same treatment setup as the previous approved digital setup should be planned. Do not just approve the digital setup once it is ready. It is still as important as previously to go through all the details in the digital setup and review it meticulously as we have described in a previous chapters. This is because there will always be a risk that the technicians have changed some important parameters. To improve predictability and to reduce the time spent on revisions, it is well worth the time spent on controlling the details in the new setup prior to approval. Common tracking issues Tracking issues not related to production errors occur when teeth do not move according to the virtual treatment plan. This becomes evident when the aligner does not fit properly over the teeth or does not engage with the attachments as intended. When the aligner is fully seated in the patient's mouth, tracking issues often present as visible gaps or air pockets between the aligner and the teeth. If tracking issues are discovered toward the end of the treatment, remove the aligners from the patient's mouth and carefully assess the clinical results. Clinical assessment 1.Is the aesthetic result satisfactory? 2.If restorative treatment has been planned: Are the teeth positioned satisfactorily? 3.Does the occlusion appear ideal? 4.Is the function acceptable? 5.Is the patient satisfied? If the aligners snap into place and the clinical result looks good, no further action is needed, even if the aligner initially appears not to fit perfectly. It is important to evaluate the clinical situation to ensure it aligns with your treatment objectives and meets the patient's expectations. If the clinical situation is not ideal but manageable, and there are still a few aligners remaining in the treatment plan, continue with the treatment while closely monitoring the tracking issue. If the wear schedule is currently less than two weeks, consider reverting to a two-week schedule to help achieve the desired clinical outcome. It is worth noting that tracking issues involving a single tooth are rarely isolated to that tooth alone. Typically, these issues will cause the aligner to be deflected from multiple teeth, leading to more extensive problems if not addressed promptly. Always remember to document the clinical situation with a photo of the aligner seated in the patient's mouth. This can be invaluable for troubleshooting and understanding why a tracking issue has occurred, as well as determining what steps are needed to get back on track. Photos can be sent to clinical support along with a description of the issues (Fig 17-1). If you collaborate with an external expert, sharing images and your observations with them may   311\n17. FITTING/TRACKING ISSUES - TROUBLESHOOTING\nprovide more detailed feedback than what is typically offered by clear aligner company support. If a tracking issue is identified by the patient, consider asking them to take a picture of the clinical situation and send it to the practice. This allows you or your external treatment planning support team to evaluate the problem and decide whether it can be resolved remotely or requires an in-office visit. Other benefits of this approach include: •The patient becomes more aware of their treatment progress. •The dental team has time to consider a solution rather than needing to provide an immediate answer.

A Word About Data Protection Remember that the photos belong to the patient, who is free to use them as they wish. However, to remain HIPAA or GDPR compliant, the practice should avoid replying directly to these emails, as doing so would involve sending patient-specific data back to the patient, potentially resulting in a data protection breach. Clinical handling While a decision is being made on how to resolve the tracking issue, do not let the patient proceed with changing aligners. Instead, have the patient continue wearing the current aligner until a solution is identified. When tracking issues are detected, it is important to open the virtual treatment plan and review the planned movements for the affected tooth or teeth at the current stage. Additionally, determine if the tooth or teeth involved in the tracking issue are still scheduled for movement. There are various reasons why air can appear between a tooth and the aligner. If the air is evenly distributed along the incisal edge, the obvious reason is that the tooth is not extruding as planned. Reviewing the movement chart in the virtual treatment plan will indicate the planned movements. Examining the specific tooth movements at the current step in the treatment will show whether any extrusion movements have been planned for that tooth. This is crucial because unwanted intrusions can occur as well as planned extrusion. Here is a list of the most common fitting issues: •Uneven tooth movement •Air gaps between the aligner and the incisal edges of one or more anterior teeth •Wobbling of the aligner on the posterior teeth •Displacement of the aligner from one or more teeth •Improper fit of one or more attachments/engagers •Broken or lost attachments (depending on the bond strength) •Over or under correction. Uneven Tooth Movement Uneven tooth movement occurs when some teeth shift according to the planned treatment while others do not, resulting in misalignment between the teeth and the aligner. This discrepancy can cause gaps, pressure points, or poor fit, affecting the overall effectiveness of the treatment. 312 Fig 17-1 Tracking issues 17. FITTING/TRACKING ISSUES - TROUBLESHOOTINGCauses: 1.Treatment Planning Issues: Inaccurate or incomplete treatment planning can lead to discrepancies in tooth movement. This might include errors in the virtual setup or incorrect assumptions about how teeth will move. 2.Attachment or Engager Problems: Misplaced or improperly fitted attachments and engagers can affect the movement of specific teeth. If attachments are not in the correct position or are not securely bonded, they may not provide the necessary forces for tooth movement. 3.Biological Response: Individual biological responses can vary. Some teeth may move slower or differently due to factors like bone density, root structure, or the presence of dental issues such as crowding or spacing. 4.Patient Compliance: Inconsistent wear of the aligners, failure to adhere to the prescribed schedule, or improper use can lead to uneven movement. For instance, if a patient does not wear aligners for the recommended number of hours per day, certain teeth may not progress as planned. 5.Initial Tooth Position: If teeth are not in the exact position as assumed in the treatment plan, the aligner might not fit correctly, causing misalignment issues. For example, if a tooth is misaligned or has drifted from its intended position, the aligner may not be able to move it properly. Effects: 1.Misalignment: The aligner may not fit correctly over the teeth, causing gaps or pressure points where the aligner does",

This can lead to discomfort and reduced treatment efficacy. 2.Tracking Issues: The aligner may not \"track\" properly, meaning it does not conform to the teeth as intended. This can create areas where the aligner sits poorly or fails to apply the correct pressure for tooth movement. 3.Delayed Treatment: Uneven movement can lead to delays in achieving the desired results, requiring adjustments or additional aligners to correct the issue. Management: 1.Review Treatment Plan: Assess the virtual treatment plan and compare it with the current tooth positions to identify discrepancies. Adjust the plan if necessary. 2.Check Attachments: Ensure that attachments and engagers are correctly placed and securely bonded. Adjust or replace them if needed. 3.Monitor and Adjust: Regularly monitor the patient’s progress and make necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. This might include additional aligners or modifications to the existing ones. 4.Improve Compliance: Reinforce the importance of following the aligner wear schedule and other instructions to the patient. By addressing these issues promptly and effectively, you can help ensure that all teeth 313 17. FITTING/TRACKING ISSUES - TROUBLESHOOTINGmove as planned and that the aligners work as intended, leading to a more successful treatment outcome. The Watermelon Seed Effect Unwanted intrusion is often observed in lateral incisors, a phenomenon commonly referred to as the \"watermelon seed effect.\" This occurs when the contact points of the neighbouring teeth are positioned in a way that allows them to push the lateral incisor apically when approximal pressure is applied, creating a compression-like movement (Fig 17-2). To help resolve this issue, ensure that the contact points are accessible with dental floss, which indicates whether they are too tight. Additionally, all approximal contact surfaces should be parallel to prevent further intrusion due to compression. Create a cutout in the aligner on both the facial and lingual sides of the non-tracking tooth. We recommend a slit on the lingual side and a cutout for a button on the buccal surface, though several variations exist. Bond a button to the buccal (and/or lingual) surface of the tooth, based on your preference. Place the aligner on the teeth, then attach an elastic band from the slit on the lingual surface, over the top of the aligner, to the button on the buccal surface. Ensure that the distance from the button to the edge of the cutout matches the gap visible in the aligner (Fig 17-3). If there isn't enough space for the tooth to move, the aligner will eventually contact the button and prevent further movement. Using this method typically resolves the issue within 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the time required for the biological response to bring the tooth back on track. Alternatively, you can opt to perform a new IO scan, take photographs, and create a case revision. However, this approach often involves more chair time and additional planning. Intrusion Challenges Intrusions and extrusions are among the most challenging movements to achieve with clear aligners. As a result, air between the aligner and 314 Fig 17-2 watermelon seed effect Fig 17-3 Intrusion with button 17. FITTING/TRACKING ISSUES - TROUBLESHOOTINGthe teeth can occur if the neighbouring teeth are not intruding as planned. If you suspect that tracking issues are related to intrusion challenges, review the virtual treatment plan and analyse the movement of the teeth. Check the placement of attachments/engagers that are necessary for providing anchorage during intrusion movements. If the tracking issue is not due to biological factors or patient compliance, it is often because there is insufficient anchorage for the intrusion.",

      "text": "In such cases, take a new scan and updated photos, and make a revision of the case, ensuring adequate anchorage is planned. Rotations If a tooth is not rotating as planned, the aligner will often be displaced from the tooth surface, riding on top of the attachment or engager. In such cases, the aligner does not fit well on either the tooth or the attachment/engager, and sometimes, the attachments or engagers may break if the tooth fails to track properly. Depending on the direction of the rotation deficiency, one or two buttons can be placed on the tooth with tracking issues, as well as on both neighbouring teeth. Elastics are then used to create the necessary rotational forces. Utilising both neighbouring teeth for anchorage minimises the risk of unwanted rotations in those teeth (Fig 17-4). To implement this, create a cutout in the aligner at the desired locations for button placement. Ensure that the cutout is large enough to allow the button to move freely within the aligner during rotation, without being impeded by the aligner material. Attach a small elastic band or a piece of power chain, positioning it so that the force aids the rotation. The aligner will act as a guide to help position the tooth correctly while being influenced by the rotational forces of the elastics. Remember, applying Newton's third law is crucial in this process. The anchorage for the elastics should be planned to prevent unwanted movements of the neighbouring teeth. If significant rotation is needed, the same button technique can be applied to both the facial and lingual sides of the tooth that is not rotating as planned (Fig. 17-4). Alternatively, you can always perform a new IO scan, take updated photos, and revise the case. When making a revision, it is helpful to compare the initial virtual treatment plan with the new starting position to identify which movements have not occurred as planned. This analysis can highlight what went wrong during the treatment and which movements are lacking. With this information, you can reflect on previous treatment decisions made during the planning phase. Based on this analysis, it may be beneficial to add cutouts for buttons and elastics in the revised setup. Overcorrection Traditionally overcorrection refers to the intentional movement of teeth beyond their ideal final position during treatment. The aim of overcorrection is to anticipate a potential relapse   315\nFig 17-4 Rotations with button and elastics\n17. FITTING/TRACKING ISSUES - TROUBLESHOOTINGafter the fixed appliances are being removed. By moving the teeth slightly beyond their desired final alignment, the orthodontist allows for some degree of rebound or shifting, helping ensure that the teeth settle in the correct position after treatment is complete. Overcorrection is often used in cases where there is a strong tendency for relapse, such as with rotated teeth or certain bite corrections. In clear aligner treatment, overcorrection is often referred to in situations where the clear aligners may not be able to achieve the desired end result. By overcorrecting the final position in the virtual treatment plan, the idea is that the clear aligners will be able to add additional forces to the teeth resulting in a final desired position between the realistic and the overcorrected plan. However, applying this overcorrection mindset can lead to problems. Unlike fixed appliances, clear aligners are designed to fit precisely and apply controlled forces to move teeth gradually. If a movement is planned to exceed realistic expectations by applying excessive forces to achieve a desired position, the aligner may become deformed. This deformation can cause a poor fit across multiple teeth, leading to significant tracking issues. Consequently, the concept of overcorrection that works in traditional orthodontics cannot be directly applied to aligner treatment. With fixed appliances, however, this kind of overcorrection is a commonly used technique. For example, if a bracket will not move a tooth into the desired position by design, the orthodontist can adjust the wire or the bracket position on the tooth to achieve an overcorrection. This involves bending the wire or applying additional forces to move the tooth further than needed, knowing that the actual movement will likely fall short of this target either due to biological resistance or because of relapse after treatment. By intentionally overcorrecting, the orthodontist aims to achieve the desired final long term tooth position. If overcorrection is planned due to a suspected relapse this will affect the choice of retention after the clear aligner treatment has ended. In these instances utilising clear aligners as retainers may not be an appropriate choice of retention. Inaccuracies in aligner fabrication can also contribute to overcorrection. If the aligner is manufactured incorrectly, it may apply too much pressure and cause what seems to be an overcorrection. Likewise, a production error causing insufficient pressure may cause the insufficient movement (some refer to this as under correction). Patient compliance is another important factor. Insufficient wear time or non-compliance can prevent the aligners from achieving the necessary movements, leading to under correction. When over or under correction occurs, the aligner may not fit properly. In cases of over correction, the aligner might not seat well due to an intent to perform excessive tooth movement. This will present as an aligner not fitting the teeth supposed to function as anchorage. Some doctors define tracking issues as under correction. This happens when the aligner does not align correctly with the teeth that are supposed to move,  according to the virtual treatment plan, creating gaps between the teeth and the aligner. This misalignment can delay treatment and potentially compromise the final   316",

RETAINERSRETAINERS Any orthodontic treatment necessitates retention to maintain the teeth in their final position, regardless of the extent of movement. Whether a few or many teeth have been shifted, a retainer is essential to keep them in place. Even if no orthodontic treatment has been carried out, a retention device is needed to preserve the teeth in a desired position. Ideally, this retention should be combined with achieving optimal occlusion and harmonious function to ensure long-term stability. The Battle to Preserve Perfect Smiles -  When Retention Threatens Restorative Success Dr. Thompson stood in her office, gazing out the window, lost in thought. The vibrant cityscape outside her dental practice offered little comfort. The smile she had perfected on her patient earlier that day - one that should have filled her with pride - left her with an unsettling sense of dread. It wasn’t the treatment itself that troubled her; it was what came next. The dreaded retention phase. Anna had been a dentist for over a decade, specialising in comprehensive restorative treatments including clear aligner treatments. She had helped countless patients achieve their dream smiles, meticulously guiding them through the process. But no matter how flawless the treatment, she always found herself grappling with the same question: How to keep those newly aligned teeth in place? For years, she had relied on the standard approach - a bonded retainer from canine to canine in the mandible, paired with removable clear aligners provided by the aligner company. It was the method she had been trained to use, the method she trusted. But lately, it felt more like a losing battle. The retention method that had once seemed so reliable was now causing more problems than it solved. Her patients often required post-orthodontic restorative work, especially on their anterior teeth. And this is where the trouble began. Every time she completed the restorative work - whether it was crowns, veneers, or composite bonding - he faced severe relapse. Teeth shifted, aligners no longer fit, and worse, she sometimes had to redo all the restorative work because the crowns or veneers from the lab simply wouldn’t fit the newly positioned teeth. It was a nightmare. The tension between wanting to let the posterior teeth settle into a better occlusion and the rigidity of the aligner retainers gnawed at her. The aligners, while effective, prevented the natural settling she knew was necessary for some patients. But the alternative - relying solely on bonded retainers - felt inadequate. The risk of emergency appointments due to debonding, fractures, or accidental tooth movements was too high. And then there was the hygiene issue, not to mention the discomfort for patients. Anna sighed, her mind spinning with these dilemmas. She had devoted her career to giving people their best smiles, yet the retention phase threatened to undo all her hard work. She knew something had to change, but what? Biological considerations The teeth are constantly moving and adapting to the forces affecting them. As we get older all   322",

Ie. the patient will never forget to use the retainer. 2.It is almost invisible or at least visually discrete as they are typically bonded to the lingual surface of the teeth.  3.They can be customised and placed on two or more teeth depending on the specific need of the patient. 4.Placed correctly it will be able to function correctly for many years.  5.Since it is only the anterior teeth that are bonded to the retainer. The bonded retainer enables the posterior teeth to settle into a more ideal occlusion after finishing the orthodontic treatment.  6.Restorative dentistry is fairly easy to perform on most teeth (the ones not bonded to the retainer) without the need for a new retainer.    323",

However, it will rarely happen in reality as orthodontic movements are never THAT precise, no matter what kind of orthodontic appliances are used during treatment) Classic retention appliances There are other types of removable appliances that can be used successfully in the maxilla in combination with either a bonded retainer in the mandible or maybe also in the maxilla. These acrylic plates are designed to allow vertical tooth movement and are equipped with a palatal plate to prevent transverse relapse, which is especially important to prevent if the upper jaw has been transversely expanded. Examples of these kinds of retainers are: Jensen retainer This is a maxillary retainer consisting of an acrylic plate covering the palate and supports all the maxillary teeth on the palatal surface. This prevents a relapse after expansion in the maxilla and allows the maxillary teeth to settle. In addition to the acrylic plate the retainer has an embedded square wire bend to fit the facial surfaces of the anterior 4-8 teeth in the maxilla (Fig 18-1). By using a square wire, that is bent to fit the facial curvature of the anterior teeth. The Jensen retainer offers more support and stability to the final position of the anterior teeth compared to the alternative acrylic plates using round metal wires. Hawley retainer This is usually a maxillary retainer with an acrylic plate covering the palate (Fig 18-2). But can also be designed for the mandible. Like the Jensen retainer, the Hawley retainer is great at preventing relapse after expansion of the maxillary teeth while allowing the teeth to settle. In addition, it has a round wire bend to fit the facial surface of either all teeth in the maxilla or a wire design kind of like the Jensen retainer but with a round wire. Begg retainer The Begg Retainer is quite similar to the Hawley retainer in design. It consists of an acrylic plate that covers the palate and a wire that wraps around all the teeth in the maxilla (Fig 18-3). The primary distinction is that the Begg retainer is slightly more rigid than the Hawley, providing more control over tooth movement while still allowing for minor settling of the teeth post-treatment. Due to its rigidity, the Begg retainer is typically used when more structured retention is desired after orthodontic treatment. 325 Fig 18-1 Jensen retainer Fig 18-2 Hawley retainer 18. RETAINERS The Jensen, Hawley and Begg retainers are typically used in the maxilla in combination with a bonded retainer in the mandible. This allows for a great settling of the teeth after orthodontic treatment. These types of retainers are especially popular after the use of traditional orthodontic treatments with brackets and wires. But are in reality just as good for any kind of orthodontic system - like clear aligners. Essix retainer This retainer looks like a clear aligner, however, it is made of a different type of plastic and typically covers more of the soft tissue than a clear aligner (Fig 18-4). Combining a bonded retainer with a clear aligner retainer is indeed an option worth considering. This approach allows for the advantages of both retainer types to be maximised. The bonded retainer offers the convenience of staying on the teeth continuously, eliminating the need for the patient to insert it into their mouth. Especially when significant movement of the anterior teeth occurs during aligner treatment, it's often advisable to employ both a bonded retainer and a clear aligner retainer for comprehensive retention.",

Especially when significant movement of the anterior teeth occurs during aligner treatment, it's often advisable to employ both a bonded retainer and a clear aligner retainer for comprehensive retention. Retainer considerations Determining the ideal retainer for a patient isn't governed by a standard rule; rather, it hinges on the specific clinical scenario and the orthodontic adjustments made during treatment. Generally, we lean towards utilising the clear aligner retainer, often in conjunction with a bonded retainer. Upon completion of the entire clear aligner treatment, we meticulously assess the fit of the final aligner. If it snugly fits all teeth, we can fabricate a retainer based on the last stage of the treatment plan. This eliminates the necessity for a new intraoral scan of the patient. In addition we have noticed that the teeth most often settle into the last aligner when it is used for a prolonged period of time. This improves the precision of the virtual treatment plan. We assume this is due to the fact, that aligners seem to be more precise when worn for a longer period of time. A two week wear schedule is in fact more precise than a one week wear schedule (depending on the planned movements in the virtual treatment plan). No matter the type of retention the end result will never be 100% as the final step in the virtual treatment plan. This is no different compared to conventional orthodontics. It is however hard to compare how big the difference is, as conventional orthodontics does not rely on the same type of detailed documented backwards 326 Fig 18-4 Essix retainer Fig 18-3 Begg retainer 18. RETAINERSplanning as the virtual treatment plan utilised in clear aligner treatments. Nonetheless, it's crucial to capture clinical photos to document the final outcome for the patient's medical records. When choosing the appropriate retention strategy for a patient post-treatment, several essential factors must be considered: 1.Type of tooth movement during treatment: The specific movements the teeth have undergone during treatment play a significant role in determining the most effective retention method. Movements such as rotations, significant intrusions or extrusions, and closing of gaps require different approaches to retention. Teeth that have undergone complex movements are generally more prone to relapse, and this needs to be factored into the retention plan. 2.Requirements for maintaining the final tooth position: Retaining teeth in their final position requires careful planning, particularly for teeth with unique challenges. Teeth with smaller clinical crowns, like maxillary lateral incisors or mandibular incisors, or those with rounder surfaces like canines, may be difficult to stabilise with clear aligners alone. These teeth tend to rotate or shift within the aligner. In cases where teeth have been rotated more than 15-20 degrees, a bonded retainer is typically necessary. A bonded retainer helps prevent rotation by physically holding the teeth in place, offering a more reliable and stable solution than aligners alone. 3.Long-term stability and balanced forces: Long-term stability of the teeth requires not only an effective retention method but also balanced occlusal forces. For instance, if the anterior mandibular teeth have been intruded by 3-4 millimeters, this movement can be challenging to maintain, particularly with clear aligners. Even with the use of a bonded retainer in combination with aligners, there is always the potential for some degree of relapse over time. As the teeth naturally try to return to their original position, this can affect the occlusion and lead to further complications. Therefore, it’s important",

      "text": "to regularly assess the stability of the occlusion and the effectiveness of the retainer over time. Additionally, the type of retainer chosen - whether fixed or removable - should be evaluated based on the patient's ability to comply with the treatment, the forces applied to the teeth post-treatment, and the risk of relapse. Teeth that were significantly moved during treatment may require longer-term or permanent retention to prevent shifting. 4.Occlusion and function: Any relapse in tooth position can have a significant impact on the patient’s occlusion. For example, if intruded teeth begin to extrude slightly over time, it could alter the way the upper and lower teeth come together, potentially leading to malocclusion or functional issues like discomfort or wear. As such, it must be considered not just how to retain the 327 18. RETAINERSteeth but how any potential changes in tooth position could influence the overall bite and long-term dental health. Ortho-restorative retention challenges If the treatment performed is an ortho restorative case, planning and timing of retention are crucial. Even a few hours without a retainer immediately at the end of treatment can result in relapse. Planning retention is therefore of utmost importance. A bonded retainer may be a useful option if composite bonding is performed. This will keep the teeth in position until an additional retainer can be produced in a dental lab and sent to the practice. In any case a new scan needs to be performed for the production of clear aligner retainers after all restorative work has been finished. Be aware that there needs to be a very clear plan and timeline for the restorative work in combination with a plan for the retention during the restorative treatment if not major relapse can occur during the restorative phase of the treatment. If restorative work needs to be done after the clear aligner therapy has ended. New IO scans are needed for the production of clear aligner retainers to fit the new shapes of the teeth. Timing the restorative work can be a little challenging as all restorative treatment needs to be finished in one appointment if at all possible. If porcelain restorations are planned. Connected provisional crowns or veneers in a composite material may be able to be used as a retainer. However it has to be bonded more securely into place than usually to make sure the teeth will not rotate or move within the provisional restorations while the patient is waiting for the permanent restoration. (if more teeth are being treated side by side). Once provisionals have been placed, the final composite bonding has been performed or the final porcelain restorations have been cemented. We recommend making an in-house Essix retainer right away and place it the same day as the provisional/final restorations. In addition, when final restorations have been placed a new IO-Scan needs to be made for the production of the final retainers. While waiting for the final retainers the patient wears the Essix retainers. As mentioned it is crucial to use some sort of retainer to retain the teeth in the final position at all times. Especially during the first 6 months after orthodontic treatment has ended. Relapse can occur really fast. Even a few hours without retention is sometimes enough for a minor relapse to occur. A few days without a retainer is often enough for a major relapse to occur. Therefore planning retention during a restorative phase is crucial. If a patient is likely to have restorative work done in the future. Consider whether a Hawley or Jensen retainer is a better alternative to a clear aligner.",

Retainer wear schedule It is a fact that it is important to retain the teeth. A question we are always asked is when and how to use the clear aligner retainer. Before answering this question consider the biology. Just as it takes time for bone remodelling to start, it takes time for the bone remodelling and the fibres to settle into the new position. The bone and the periodontal fibres will not be considered stable until 6 to 8   328\n18. RETAINERSmonths after the orthodontic movements have stopped. Therefore it is crucial for the patient to wear the retainer full-time in the beginning when there is the highest risk of relapse. Our protocol for removable retainers is as follows: -The first three months: Full-time wear after the last aligner. -After 3 months with full time retention: 16 hours a day for the next three months -After 6 months: 8 hours a day for the rest of the patients life - no exceptions! Most humans are much more prone to use a rigid plan, rather than a flexible one that allows for some individual adjustments. If a flexible approach is used it almost always ends up with the patient forgetting to use their retainers, which again will lead to a need for a revision. We typically deliver two sets of aligner retainers to the patients. Instructing them to use the one for the first 6 months and store the other set as a reference retainer. Roughly once a month the patient takes out the stored reference retainer and tries it on. If the reference retainer has more or less the same tension on the teeth as the retainer that is being worn every day, everything is fine and the reference retainer can be stored again. If the patient feels that the reference retainer is giving a lot more pressure on the teeth compared to the one used every day, then it is time to change to the new retainer (the reference retainer). Setting expectations With this understanding of the importance of retention, it is crucial to inform any clear aligner patient about the necessity of lifelong retention before starting orthodontic treatment. Patients often express dissatisfaction when they are not informed about this requirement ahead of time. While using retainers is not problematic, patients can become annoyed if they are unaware of the lifelong commitment before signing up for treatment. Recognising that patients are often reluctant to commit to prolonged clear aligner treatment before experiencing it themselves, they typically request the shortest possible treatment time. However, once treatment begins, their attitude usually changes. Patients become accustomed to the feeling and use of aligners and realise that the plastic covering their teeth is hardly noticeable. Consequently, they are more willing to extend the treatment duration beyond what was initially indicated in the virtual treatment plan. Resolving Dr. Thompson’s challenges Dr. Thompson's frustration reached its peak when she encountered one particularly challenging case. Her patient, a young woman named Miriam, had undergone extensive clear aligner treatment to correct a deep bite and crowding in the lower arch. The results were stunning, but Anna knew the retention phase would be crucial to maintaining that success. This time, she decided to try something different. She reached out to us, seeking advice on how to overcome the issues that had plagued her for years. We listened to her concerns - the struggles with bonded retainers, the limitations of aligner retainers, and the challenge of post-orthodontic restorative work. Together, we devised a new retention strategy tailored to Miriam's needs. We suggested a combination of a more extensive bonded retainer, extending beyond the canines to include the premolars, paired first with a custom modified Hawley retainer and a motor bonded maxillary   329\n18. RETAINERSretainer during the restorative phase. Followed by a clear aligner retainer. This approach would offer the stability Anna sought while allowing for the natural settling of the posterior teeth. Additionally, we recommended planning the restorative work carefully in tandem with the retention phase, ensuring minimal disruption and reducing the risk of relapse. Anna followed the new plan meticulously. When Miriam returned for her follow-up, the difference was remarkable. The teeth had settled into a more ideal occlusion without the relapse Anna had feared. The custom aligner retainer fit perfectly over Miriam’s newly restored anterior teeth, ensuring they stayed in place. For the first time in years, Anna felt a sense of relief. The constant worry about retention was gone. The success with Miriam’s case transformed Anna’s practice. She began implementing a new retention strategy with her other patients, carefully planning each case and choosing the most appropriate retainer for each situation. The result? Fewer emergency appointments, more satisfied patients, and best of all, no more redoing restorative work. Dr. Thompson had finally found a solution to the retention dilemma that had haunted her for so long. She could now confidently assure her patients that their beautiful new smiles would last a lifetime. The tension that had once filled her office was replaced with a renewed sense of purpose and a calm certainty that she was providing the best care possible. As she closed the chapter on her retention struggles, Anna smiled - a genuine, contented smile - knowing that she had not only mastered the art of aligning teeth but also the science of keeping them that way. 330",

It is essential to recognise that your personal success can only be defined by yourself. We strongly emphasise the importance of self-honesty in this regard. Too often we consult doctors who tell themselves their current situation is what they strive for as success. Yet they feel miserably.

The more we educate ourselves in professionally complex treatments, such as occlusion, implantology, orthodontics or periodontology, the more the triangle of clinical skills grows. Notice that we have positioned the triangle upside down (Fig 19-2). This illustrates how our professional skills alone are an unstable element to build a dental practice on.  Clinical skills cannot stand alone If we don't support our professional competencies, it's easy to tip the triangle, making it fall to one or the other side. This will bring down the entire practice. A tipped triangle achieves success - however, that success may be defined.  A tipped triangle only creates more challenges.  The more complex treatments we manage to solve, the more unstable the triangle becomes without support.  Supporting the clinical skills Patient communication To be successful, we need to support the clinical skills with leadership and patient communication (Fig 19-3). If we can't make patients want to invest in the treatment they need, we won't be able to bring our clinical skills into play.  The level of communication skills is proportionate with the amount of complex dentistry we get to perform. Leadership If we don't have a clear direction and systems in the practice that support efficient operations, we won't be able to realise the full potential of the dental practice.  At a glance In the images of the model, you can see that there are different levels of the triangles that support the clinical skills. This is because each element contains a number of levels to help us find out our current status. It creates an overview and helps us see what we can focus on next to improve our current level. Assuming we want to improve the practice and our own level of success.  Please note that there is no right or wrong thing to do in this. There is no one right way that embraces all dental practices. On the contrary, we believe that each practice owner's path to success is individual.  \n  337Fig 19-2 Clinical skills\nFig 19-3 Supporting the clinical skills\n19. FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS\nThe lowest denominator In Fig 19-4, 3 different competence levels have been marked in the areas: Communication, Clinical skills and Leadership. In this particular practice the doctor is highly skilled and able to perform very complex treatments. However there is only a mediocre level of leadership and a low level of communication skills.  The interesting part is, that it will always be the lowest denominator determining how much the clinical skills of the doctor will come into play (Fig. 19-5). Basis for dental success Communication, clinical skills and leadership Common to all dental offices is that the elements we describe, and the individual levels of each element, are of basic and crucial importance for the practice to provide the success that the practice owner has defined for himself or herself. When we have a strong foundation based on strong clinical skills, supported by good patient communication skills and clear leadership, only then is the practice truly ready to grow and reap the full benefits of branding and marketing investments. When things go wrong All too often we spend vast amounts of time and resources to become extremely skilled professionals. This might lead to the perception, that patients should seek us out to have their dental problems solved in our practice. Since we are obviously the best at solving these. The challenge is that patients don't come on their own and ask for treatment. In addition, they have no ability to judge our clinical skill level.  This can mislead competent dentists to start marketing their practices in the hope that patients will come in large numbers demanding the treatment that the dentists have been trained to provide.  The challenge of marketing without first building and implementing strong patient communication- and leadership skills is, that the marketing will rest on an extremely unstable foundation. Often, this means that the whole thing falls over. Meaning the clinical skills don't come into play at all while the dentist blames the marketing for not working.  In these cases, it's rare that the marketing doesn't work. It's most often a sign that some of the elements that create a strong foundation for marketing are missing.  Likewise, practices with an unstable foundation will be able to attract a lot of patients through marketing. However, the return on investment is   338\nFig 19-4\nFig 19-5 impact of the lowest denominator",

Her early career provided foundational experience in comprehensive patient care while working in a public dental pediatric practice in Kolding, Denmark. In 2007, Helle and Jesper Hatt, took over her father’s private dental practice in Skagen, Denmark. Together, they managed the clinic, with Helle focusing on oral implantology and adult orthodontics. During this time, she became one of the first practitioners in Europe to adopt innovative technologies like In2Guide for guided surgery and 3D CBCT imaging. Helle worked in the practice until 2016, leading its operations and helping it stay at the forefront of modern dentistry. Helle’s expertise in clear aligner systems became a central focus of her career. She became a Certified Invisalign Provider in 2008, which paved the way for her role as a clinical specialist. From 2016 to 2018, she served as a Clinical Specialist for Invisalign, where she coached dentists in implementing the system and delivered training courses and presentations across Europe. Her career advanced further when she became a Clinical Specialist for ClearCorrect under Straumann from 2018 to 2020. In this role, Helle was responsible for training and educating Straumann employees and dental professionals across Europe. She played a key role in integrating ClearCorrect into Straumann’s European portfolio, creating educational materials for the EMEA region, and enhancing the knowledge of aligner systems across the continent. In 2019, Helle co-founded Hatt Consulting GmbH, where she continues to serve as a Clear Aligner Expert. Her work now involves consulting with dental practices to implement clear aligner systems more efficiently, sharing her depth of experience in the field. Helle has always placed a strong emphasis on professional development. In 2010, she earned a Diploma in Oral Implantology from Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main. In 2016, she expanded her skills by becoming an NLP Business Practitioner through Mindstep, and in 2018, she completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Education from HCS International Ltd., furthering her expertise in both clinical practice and education. \n  348",
