Habits like nail-biting, tongue thrusting, and pen-biting can affect not only the progress of orthodontic treatment but also its long-term stability. This blog post delves into why oral habits matter, the common mistakes to avoid, actionable steps for integrating these considerations into your clear aligner treatment planning, answers to frequently asked questions, and a detailed walkthrough example.\nWhy Oral Habits Matter in Clear Aligner Treatment Planning\nTeeth naturally position themselves in a delicate balance between the forces exerted by the tongue, cheeks, and lips. However, oral habits disrupt this balance and can cause unintended tooth movements or relapse after orthodontic treatment.\nHere’s why addressing oral habits is essential:\nImproved Outcomes:\nIdentifying habits early ensures treatment progresses smoothly and delivers the desired results.\nPatient Satisfaction:\nFailure to address habits may lead to relapse, resulting in dissatisfied patients who might expect free corrections.\nLong-Term Retention:\nPost-treatment stability relies on correcting harmful habits that may undo months of orthodontic work.\nBy including oral habits in your clear aligner treatment planning, you enhance both patient satisfaction and treatment predictability.\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid in Oral Habits Assessment"

    "text": "Jesper Hatt DDS\nFeb 25\n3 min read\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is gaining traction in the dental industry, particularly in orthodontics and clear aligner therapy. While AI promises to simplify workflows and improve decision-making, it currently falls short when it comes to effective clear aligner treatment planning. Let’s examine why AI is not yet ready to handle the complexities of clear aligner treatment and why human expertise remains vital.\n1. Doctor Preferences and Diverse Treatment Philosophies\nOne of the major hurdles in leveraging AI for clear aligner treatment planning is the wide variation in treatment approaches among dental professionals. For example, if you present the same panoramic X-ray to 20 dentists, you’ll likely get 20 unique treatment plans. When you include clinical photos, intraoral scans, and additional variables such as:\nOrthodontic treatment preferences\nOcclusal philosophies (or lack thereof)\nSoft tissue considerations\nOpinions on post-orthodontic restorative treatment\nThe number of potential treatment plans can easily double or triple. This diversity in preferences and philosophies makes it nearly impossible for AI to generate a single, universally acceptable clear aligner treatment plan.\n2. AI’s Strength: Binary Diagnostics\nAI performs well in binary tasks, such as detecting cavities, identifying lesions, or determining if a tooth is impacted. These scenarios involve clear “yes” or “no” answers, which AI handles with high precision.\nHowever, clear"

When it comes to clear aligner treatments, it’s natural to want full control over every case. However, trying to do everything yourself can come at a significant cost, affecting not just your workload but also the efficiency and profitability of your practice.\nWhile hands-on involvement in treatment planning may seem beneficial, it often creates inefficiencies that limit growth, increase stress, and reduce overall profitability. The key to a thriving clear aligner business isn’t doing everything yourself—it’s knowing which tasks to delegate so that you can focus on what truly matters: patient care, case acceptance, and practice development.\nThe Hidden Costs of Doing It All Yourself\nMany dentists believe that personally handling every aspect of treatment planning ensures the best outcomes. While this might seem like a good idea, it often leads to unintended consequences that impact multiple areas of the practice:\n1. Increased chair time for adjustments and refinements\nWhen cases are not optimally planned from the start, additional appointments are often needed to correct tracking issues. More refinements mean more time spent on each case, reducing the availability for new patient consultations and other high-value treatments.

Underutilisation of the dental team\nA highly skilled team is often capable of handling many parts of the workflow, but when the dentist insists on managing everything, the team's potential remains untapped. Hygienists, assistants, and administrative staff can play a greater role in streamlining processes—if they are given the opportunity.\n4.

    "text": "Jesper Hatt DDS\nSep 28, 2024\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 13, 2024\nInterproximal reduction (IPR) has become a staple in modern orthodontics, especially within clear aligner therapy. This technique, which involves the reduction of enamel between adjacent teeth, is integral to achieving optimal alignment and aesthetic outcomes.\nHowever, its irreversible nature requires careful consideration and precise execution. Here, we delve into key considerations general dentists should be aware of when incorporating IPR into their clear aligner treatments.\nUnderstanding clear aligner IPR: A Brief Overview\nIPR, sometimes referred to as enamel stripping or selective reduction, is employed to create space within the dental arch. It is particularly useful in clear aligner therapy for addressing crowding, resolving tooth size discrepancies, and improving overall aesthetics. Since IPR alters the tooth structure permanently, accurate planning and execution are paramount.\nKey Considerations for Effective IPR\nIndications for IPR\nSpace Creation:\nIPR is often used to alleviate crowding, especially in the anterior segment where space is needed to align misaligned teeth. For minor to moderate crowding, IPR offers a non-extraction alternative that reduces the overall distance teeth need to move.\nTooth Size Discrepancies:\nThe Bolton ratio, which compares the size of the anterior and posterior teeth, often necessitates IPR to correct discrepancies. This helps in achieving the desired overbite and overjet."

    "text": "Tooth Shape Adjustments:\nReshaping teeth through IPR can improve aesthetics and facilitate better alignment. However, it is crucial to avoid excessive enamel removal, which can lead to structural issues and increased sensitivity.\nTechniques and Tools\nInstruments:\nVarious tools are available for performing IPR, including abrasive metal strips, diamond discs, and burs. Each tool has its advantages and disadvantages. Manual adjustments should only be cosidered .when very small changes (0,1-0,2 mm) are to be performed on onse side of a tooth in order to change the morphology. With bigger changes it takes too long, the precision is reduced and too much enamel will be removed from one tooth. In these isntances use the\nDentatus IPR set instead.\nTechnique:\nThe procedure should be done conservatively. It is often recommended to perform IPR gradually and to monitor the process carefully to avoid over-reduction. We prefer correct planning in combination with a calibrated IPR system. Polishing post-IPR is essential to smoothen the surface and reduce enamel roughness.\nPatient Considerations\nTooth Sensitivity and Pulp Health:\nIPR can elevate tooth temperature and potentially cause sensitivity if rotating instruments are used. Utilizing coolant during these kind of procedures and monitoring pulp health are crucial to mitigate these effects. Alternatively use a slower occiliating system.\nOral Hygiene:\nPatients must maintain excellent oral hygiene to prevent caries and periodontal issues,"

    "text": "especially since IPR can alter the surface texture of teeth.\nContraindications\nEnamel Thickness and Tooth Shape:\nIPR is not advisable if the enamel is too thin or if the tooth shape is not conducive to reduction. For instance, rectangular or square-shaped teeth may not be ideal candidates for extensive IPR.\nExisting Conditions:\nAvoid performing IPR in patients with active periodontal disease, poor oral hygiene, or enamel hypoplasia. Additionally, be cautious with patients who have large pulp chambers or significant crowding that impedes access to the contact areas.\nBlind trust in the digital setup:\nClear aligner technicians or the artificial intelligens creating the initial digital setups will sometimes plan agressive IPR in cases that will lead to severe malocclusions if their suggestions are followed.\nImpact on Treatment Outcomes\nAesthetic and Functional Results:\nIPR can improve aesthetic outcomes by correcting tooth alignment and enhancing gingival contours. However, it is essential to assess the potential for creating black triangles or other aesthetic issues post-treatment.\nLong-term Stability:\nIPR should be used thoughtfully to ensure that it contributes positively to long-term treatment stability. Research suggests that well-executed IPR can help maintain arch width and improve stability when combined with other orthodontic techniques.\nPrecision and Planning\nDigital Planning:\nWith advancements in digital orthodontics, precise planning for IPR is now possible.

Do not start explaining the necessary orthodontic movements until you have a complete understanding of the patient. This enables you to focus on the benefits in the eyes of the patient. Save the details about the aligners for later. Focus on listening to your patient’s"

Set aside the first 15 minutes of the initial appointment asking about personal matters and dental issues. I know 15 minutes is a lot of time in any dental office. To spend this amount of time forces you to ask a lot of questions. Keep the questions related to the teeth, the smile and how the patients desired future smile will benefit the patient (from the patients perspective) This personalised approach shows patients they are more than just another case to you. Asking questions and actively listening can significantly enhance their trust in you.\nStep\n#3\n: Demonstrate competence\nPatients need to feel confident in your ability to treat their smile. Show before-and-after photos of patients you have treated previously to illustrate the results you can achieve. These don’t have to match the patient’s exact condition but should demonstrate your expertise and the successful outcomes of your treatments. This helps build motivation and trust.\nStep\n#4\n: Explain why: Be rational\nSpend a maximum of 5 minutes explaining the benefits of orthodontic treatment. Use words or visuals to illustrate the potential consequences not treating the dental conditions of your patient. Avoid addressing the patient directly. Instead tell the patient what you typically see in other patients with similar conditions, that are not being treated, such as worn, cracked, or fractured teeth and simply ask"

One crucial element that can significantly impact the success of a SureSmile treatment plan is the strategic use of attachments. Understanding the role these small, yet powerful, components play can make all the difference in achieving optimal results for your patients.\nIn this blog post, we'll explore the purpose, application, and best practices for using SureSmile attachments, providing you with the knowledge to enhance your clear aligner treatments and elevate patient outcomes.\nThe Role of SureSmile Attachments in Clear Aligner Therapy\nSureSmile attachments, sometimes referred to as \"engagers\" or \"buttons,\" are small, tooth-colored composite resin pieces that are temporarily bonded to specific teeth. Their primary function is to improve the efficacy of aligner-based tooth movements by providing additional surface area for the aligner to grip, enabling more complex or stubborn tooth movements.\nWhile SureSmile aligners are custom-designed to fit snugly over the teeth, certain movements—such as extrusions, rotations, or significant bodily movements—often require a more targeted application of force. Attachments serve as anchor points that allow the aligners to apply this force with greater precision and control.\nReady to take your aligner treatments to the next level?"

The attachments may however become so big, that it makes the aligners hard to position and remove.\nOptimizing Force Distribution\n: Properly placed attachments help distribute forces more evenly across the tooth surface, reducing unwanted  movements. This leads to more predictable outcomes and can reduce the need for mid-course corrections. Therefore every attachment should be positioned and evaluated according to the planned tooth movements.\nImproving Retention and Fit\n: Attachments improve the aligners' grip on the teeth, which is especially useful for patients with a need for challenging movements. During the planning of the attachment position. It is worth remembering that aligners only work with pushing movements.\nReducing Treatment Time\n: When attachments are used correctly, they can shorten overall treatment time by ensuring that tooth movements occur as planned with each aligner change. This can reduce the need for refinements and additional trays, leading to a more streamlined treatment process.\nBest Practices for Placing SureSmile Attachments\nAs with any orthodontic appliance, the placement and management of SureSmile attachments are critical to their success.

Explain that attachments are a normal and temporary part of the process, which can alleviate any concerns about their appearance or function.\nHygiene Management\n: Emphasize the importance of oral hygiene around the attachments. Plaque accumulation can compromise the treatment as it may lead to complications such as staining or decay.\nRegular Monitoring\n: During the regular check-ins always assess the integrity of the attachments and the progress of the treatment. If an attachment becomes dislodged or if tooth movement is not progressing as expected a revision may be necessary.\nCommon Questions and Considerations\nAs you integrate SureSmile attachments into your practice, you may encounter questions or challenges.

This position is crucial in ensuring a harmonious and functional bite, particularly in adult patients whose skeletal growth has ceased.\nUnfortunately, current clear aligner software and production processes struggle to accurately accommodate CR. The primary reason is that most clear aligner systems lack the capability to integrate with a virtual articulator—a digital tool that simulates the movement of the jaws.

However, this approach is far from realistic, especially when treating adults. In children with growing jaws, orthodontists might get away with such adjustments, but adults require a more precise and tailored approach.\nWorkarounds for Managing Centric Relation\nDespite the limitations, there are a few strategies that can be employed to work around the challenges of CR in clear aligner therapy:\nPre-Mounting Models in an Articulator\nOne option is to mount your models in a physical articulator before beginning digital aligner treatment planning. By registering the difference between Maximum Intercuspation Position (MIP) and CR, you can perform minor equilibration until a reasonable occlusion is achieved, ideally on at least two molars and the second premolar bilaterally. Transferring your registrations on the models to the mouth of the patient, allows you to position the bite in CR within the aligner software, providing a relatively stable starting point for treatment.\nHowever, this approach is not without its drawbacks. Very few patients are suitable for initial enamel reduction, particularly since final occlusion adjustments typically occur six months into the retention phase. If enamel has already been removed at the beginning, it leaves little room for further corrections.\nVisualizing and Adjusting the End Result\nAnother approach involves identifying the"

With this information, you can visualise the desired end result and start moving the teeth towards this outcome within the aligner software.\nIt’s important to recognise that this method requires ongoing adjustments as the orthodontic treatment progresses. The initial virtual treatment plan is often just an educated guess, and revisions are necessary to adapt to the reality of the patient’s oral condition over time.\nThe Road Ahead: Challenges and Future Solutions\nThe frustration of dealing with these limitations is shared by many in the clear aligner community. There are two main reasons why managing CR in clear aligner therapy remains such a challenge:\nTraditional Orthodontic Practices\nHistorically, orthodontists have not prioritised the muscles and joints when treating patients. Although many claim to consider these factors, the use of a \"wristilator\" instead of an articulator suggests otherwise. Most dental practices, including the orthodontic practices, have an articulator collecting dust somehere. This oversight contributes to the ongoing struggle to incorporate functional occlusion principles into aligner therapy.\nComplexity and Limited Demand\nThe number of dentists with the expertise and interest in functional occlusion is small combined with clear aligner competence even smaller.

Both SureSmile and Invisalign are popular choices for general practitioners (GPs) and orthodontists. While Invisalign has established itself as a market leader, SureSmile offers unique advantages that make it a worthy contender. Here's a side-by-side comparison to help you make an informed decision for your practice.\n1. Brand Recognition\nInvisalign\nAdvantage:\nInvisalign is the most recognized brand in clear aligners, with robust marketing campaigns targeting both patients and dentists. This recognition can make it easier to communicate treatment options to patients.\nDisadvantage:\nThe reliance on branding means higher costs, which may not necessarily reflect better clinical outcomes.\nSureSmile\nAdvantage:\nSupported by Dentsply Sirona, SureSmile benefits from its association with one of the largest and most reputable dental companies globally. While it lacks Invisalign’s consumer visibility, it integrates seamlessly into Dentsply Sirona’s digital workflows, which many practices already use.\nDisadvantage:\nLimited brand recognition requires educating patients about the system and its benefits.\n2.

Practices with other scanners face additional hurdles or need to rely on PVS impressions.\nSureSmile\nAdvantage:\nSureSmile is highly flexible, accepting STL files from any intraoral scanner. Its integration with Dentsply Sirona scanners like Primescan ensures a smooth workflow for existing users.\nDisadvantage:\nWhile the software offers powerful features, it has a steep learning curve, slower load times, and a less intuitive interface. Treatment planning can take significantly longer compared to Invisalign, but the added flexibility can benefit advanced cases.\n3. Predictability of Treatment\nInvisalign\nAdvantage:\nInvisalign’s protocols are optimized for efficient workflows, but predictability relies entirely on the dentist's ability to plan and sequence the case appropriately. The aligners themselves and their AI-driven ClinCheck cannot inherently ensure predictable outcomes.\nDisadvantage:\nMovements such as crown-first sequencing (common in Invisalign setups) are faster but biologically suboptimal, increasing the risk of complications.\nSureSmile\nAdvantage:\nSureSmile’s aligners use a stiffer Essix Ace material, which, combined with the option for a straight trimline, can enhance root movement predictability when the treatment is planned correctly. SureSmile also employs more conservative movement protocols, often reducing"

    "text": "Jesper Hatt DDS\nDec 16, 2024\n5 min read\nOvercorrection is a topic that often arises in conversations with colleagues who, like us, work with clear aligners. It’s a concept borrowed from fixed appliances, where the idea is to anticipate and counteract limitations in movement predictability by applying extra force or modifying the appliance. While this approach has its place in traditional orthodontics, applying the same mindset to clear aligners can lead to challenges that may compromise treatment outcomes.\nWhat is Overcorrection?\nIn fixed appliances, overcorrection involves compensating for anticipated limitations in tooth movement. For instance:\nBending a Wire:\nAdjusting the archwire to apply extra force where needed.\nAppliance Modifications:\nAltering components to achieve greater pressure or movement.\nThis technique works because of the constant force and rigidity provided by the brackets and wires. The same principle has been adapted to clear aligner therapy, where movements known to be less predictable—such as a 4mm tooth intrusion—are programmed as an overcorrection in the aligner software, aiming for 6mm instead. The assumption is that the extra force will counteract the natural limitations of aligner-driven movements.\nWhy Overcorrection is Problematic in Clear Aligners\nWhile the concept makes sense in theory, applying it to clear aligners introduces several challenges:\nMisaligned Expectations\nOvercorrection assumes that the aligner’s extra force will always deliver the"

Meticulous Treatment Planning\nThe foundation of successful clear aligner therapy is thoughtful, detailed treatment planning. Each step in the aligner sequence must be carefully considered to align with the mechanical principles of aligners and the biological limitations of tooth movement.\nBreaking Movements into Predictable Steps\n:\nAligners excel at achieving small, incremental changes. Complex movements—like intrusions, rotations, or bodily shifts—should be divided into manageable stages to ensure forces remain within the predictable capabilities of aligners. For example, instead of planning a 4mm intrusion in the fewest steps possible, it should be staged over multiple aligners to allow gradual movement. Remember to go fast in orthodontics you need to reduce the forces.\nLeveraging Aligner Software\n:\nAdvanced aligner software provides tools to visualize and plan precise movements. Practitioners should utilize these tools to anticipate potential challenges and tailor the treatment plan accordingly. This includes using attachments strategically, adjusting staging to account for less predictable movements, and setting realistic expectations for each phase.\nConsidering Biomechanical Limitations\n:\nTreatment plans should respect the physical and biological constraints of aligner therapy.

To truly thrive as a profitable clear aligner provider, you need a structured system, a confident team, and well-defined workflows. By following a proven process, you can become a competent and stress-free provider, delivering exceptional results while improving profitability.\nPhase 1: Laying the Foundation for Aligner Success\nThe first step in mastering clear aligner treatments is to establish robust workflows. This isn't just about learning to move teeth; it's about building a structured orthodontic system within your practice.\nThe First Barrier: Mastering Clinical Workflows\nTake clinical photography, for example. If you only grab your camera when a patient is potential candidate for clear aligner treatment, you're making the same mistake as most dentists. How do you think a patient will perceive you, if you seem unsure about how to take the photos and fiddle around with the equipment, it hurts when you use the retractors and mirrors. Do you think this initial experience could have an influence on the way the patients expect their treatment experience to be in case they accept treatment?Photography must be second nature before you even start treating patients with clear aligners so that your confidence reassures patients and improves treatment outcomes.\nKey Tip:\nYour team should be able to capture a full"

At\nalignerservice.com\n, we partner with dentists to support every aspect of clear aligner treatments—from orthodontic diagnostics to treatment planning, troubleshooting, and clinical handling. One of the simplest yet most effective tools we often recommend in the clear aligner journey is the use of \"chewies.\" These small, easily overlooked accessories can significantly enhance treatment efficacy, ensuring that your patients achieve their desired results more quickly and comfortably.\nWhat Are Chewies?\nChewies are small, cylindrical cushions made of a soft, spongy material, typically medical-grade silicone. They are designed to help patients seat their aligners properly by biting down on the chewies, ensuring a snug and secure fit of the aligner trays against the teeth.\nWhy Are Chewies Important in Clear Aligner Therapy?\nFor clear aligner therapy to be effective, it’s crucial that the aligners fit perfectly against the teeth. Any gaps or spaces between the aligner and the teeth can lead to suboptimal tooth movement, prolonging treatment time and compromising the final outcome. Chewies play a critical role in ensuring that aligners are properly seated, particularly during the initial phase of wearing new trays, when patients are most likely to experience discomfort or fit issues."

    "text": "1.\nImproved Fit for Optimal Tooth Movement\nClear aligners work by applying gentle, consistent pressure to gradually move teeth into their desired positions. If the aligners aren’t fitting correctly, the pressure distribution can be uneven, leading to slower or incomplete tooth movement. By using chewies, patients can ensure that their aligners are fully seated, which helps maintain the precise force needed to guide teeth according to the treatment plan.\n2.\nPrevention of Air Gaps\nWhen a patient first switches to a new set of aligners, it's common to have minor air gaps between the aligner and teeth, especially around the molars. These gaps can hinder the aligner’s effectiveness, as they prevent the necessary force from being applied to the teeth. Chewies help eliminate these air gaps, allowing the aligners to fit more snugly and work more effectively.\n3.\nEnhanced Comfort\nSome patients experience discomfort when transitioning to a new aligner tray. Chewies can help alleviate this by ensuring the aligner fits more closely to the teeth, reducing the initial pressure points that can cause soreness. This not only enhances comfort but also encourages patient compliance, which is essential for successful treatment.\n4.\nShorter Treatment Time\nWhen aligners fit properly from the outset, teeth can move as planned, reducing the overall treatment time. By using chewies regularly, patients may be able to shorten their treatment duration, achieving their desired results more quickly.\n5."

As practitioners, we aim for ideal outcomes like Class I occlusion, perfect facial airway positioning, and flawless alignment. These goals, rooted in years of training and clinical practice, represent the pinnacle of what we consider successful treatment. However, one aspect that's frequently overlooked in this pursuit of perfection is the patient’s perspective.\nUnderstanding the Patient’s Priorities\nWhile our clinical goals are important, they must align with what the patient values most in their treatment. After all, the patient is the one who will live with the results of our work every day. This is why it's crucial to ensure that our objectives are in harmony with the patient's needs, expectations, and lifestyle.\nThe starting point for this alignment is communication. Before we even begin to think about treatment planning, we need to engage in a thorough dialogue with the patient. This involves not just listening to their concerns, but actively involving them in the decision-making process.\nA Comprehensive Questionnaire: The First Step\nTo facilitate this communication, a comprehensive questionnaire can be an invaluable tool.

Proper occlusion isn’t just about having a beautiful smile; it’s about ensuring that the teeth fit together in a way that promotes long-term oral health. Misalignment in this area can lead to issues such as TMJ pain, which can significantly affect a patient’s quality of life.\nSpeaking of quality of life, it’s important to ask the patient how their oral health impacts their day-to-day activities.

If the patient follows instructions perfectly and the biology responds ideally, the case might be completed without issues. But reality is rarely that simple.\nMany patients are not fully compliant, and their lack of adherence can affect treatment.\nBiological response to tooth movement is unpredictable, even with an ideal treatment plan.\nAs a consequence, any aligner case may require more than one revision to achieve optimal results.\nIf the dentist has only one revision included, any additional refinements will require a new package, dramatically increasing costs. Often, the combined expenses of these unexpected adjustments surpass what an \"all-inclusive\" package would have cost from the start. Additionally, this creates unnecessary stress for both the dentist and the patient, leading to longer treatment times and potential dissatisfaction.\nAnother scenario:\nA dentist with less than 100 cases of experience selects a 2-year package with two revisions. If a relapse occurs three years later and the patient complains, the dentist is left in a difficult position. With an \"all-inclusive\" package covering five years, however, the patient remains happy, and the only additional cost to the practice is chair time—not expensive new lab fees. The ability to confidently manage patient concerns"

Follow us on LinkedIn:\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nWhy the price difference is negligible\nMany dentists operate in markets where they can set their own fees. Even in countries where fees are regulated, lab costs are often separate from treatment fees, making it clear to patients what they are paying for. And when you compare costs, the difference between a limited package and an \"all-inclusive\" one is often less than €300/$300.\nFor treatments priced at $5,000 or more, this difference is trivial. To put it into perspective, $300 is often less than the cost of a single chairside appointment required to manage unexpected issues. Additionally, choosing a limited package often results in unanticipated costs that exceed the initial savings. Dentists must also consider the cost of their time—handling additional revisions, patient concerns, and unforeseen complications consumes valuable resources that could have been better utilized elsewhere.\nThe vast majority of patients prioritize aesthetics, function, and longevity over cost. More importantly, the ultimate factor in their decision isn’t price—it’s trust. The more a patient trusts their dentist, the easier it becomes to present ideal treatment options, even at higher fees.

Many practitioners assume that this perfect alignment should be the ultimate goal, but our extensive experience has shown otherwise. This blog post draws on the insights we've gained while advising on treatment plans, explaining why an Angle Class I molar relationship should never be the sole focus of orthodontic care.\nWhen it comes to orthodontic treatments, particularly clear aligner therapies, there's a common misconception that achieving a perfect Angle Class I molar relationship should be the ultimate goal. However, this approach is far too simplistic and overlooks the complex interplay between teeth, surrounding tissues, and overall facial structure. Here's why an Angle Class I molar relationship should never be the sole focus of orthodontic treatment.\nThe complexity of bite corrections\nCorrecting a patient's bite involves far more than just aligning the teeth to fit a perfect mold. A successful orthodontic treatment must consider the entirety of the oral and facial structure, including soft tissues, bone, and the overall health and stability of these elements. Simply aiming for a Class I relationship without taking these factors into account can lead to unintended and potentially harmful"

Correcting these to achieve a Class I relationship might seem ideal on the surface, but the necessary adjustments could have significant impacts on the patient's facial structure, requiring invasive procedures that may not be in the patient's best interest.\nFollow AlignerService on LinkedIn to get more tips and tricks related to clear aligner treatments.\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nThe role of surrounding tissues\nOrthodontic treatments must account for the surrounding soft and hard tissues that support the teeth. These tissues play a critical role in determining the feasibility and sustainability of any bite correction. In some cases, even if a Class I molar relationship is technically achievable, the required adjustments might strain these tissues, leading to instability, discomfort, or long-term health issues for the patient.\nFor adult patients, particularly those with established Class II or III relationships, achieving a Class I molar relationship might only be possible with surgical intervention. However, many of these patients may not be suitable candidates for surgery, or they may choose to avoid it due to the associated risks and recovery time. Instead, a modified Class II or III occlusion that is stable and functional can often provide a better outcome, preserving the patient’s quality of life while addressing their"

Every patient's dental and facial structure is unique, and so too should be their treatment plan. What might work for one patient with a Class II relationship could be entirely inappropriate for another. That's why it's crucial to evaluate each patient on an individual basis, considering not just their dental models, but also their extraoral and intraoral tissues, facial profile, and overall health.\nWhen we focus solely on achieving a Class I relationship, we risk overlooking these critical aspects, potentially leading to treatment plans that do more harm than good. A comprehensive approach that considers all these factors ensures that each patient receives the best possible care, tailored to their specific needs.\nThe Bigger Picture of class I relations in clear aligner treatment planning\nOrthodontic treatment is about more than just straightening teeth; it’s about creating a functional, stable, and aesthetically pleasing outcome that the patient can maintain for life. While a Class I molar relationship might be the ideal in some cases, it should never be pursued at the expense of the patient’s overall health and well-being.\nIn conclusion, an Angle Class I molar relationship should never be the primary treatment goal in itself.

For instance, studies have shown that certain 3D-printed resins possess higher flexibility but lower yield strength and elastic modulus compared to PETG, potentially affecting their performance during orthodontic procedures.\nBiocompatibility Concerns\nBiocompatibility is a critical consideration for any material intended for intraoral use. While some 3D-printable materials, such as Tera Harz TC-85 (Graphy), have received approvals from regulatory bodies like the European Commission (EC) and the Korean Food and Drug Administration (KFDA), comprehensive evaluations of their long-term biocompatibility and safety profiles are still limited. Moreover, the potential for residual monomers or other by-products to leach into the oral environment raises concerns about patient health and necessitates further rigorous testing.\nDimensional Accuracy and Fit\nAchieving precise dimensional accuracy is essential for clear aligners to effectively exert the intended forces on teeth. However, 3D printing processes can introduce discrepancies between the designed and actual aligner dimensions. Research indicates that 3D-printed aligners can exhibit increased thickness compared to their digital design files, potentially due to factors like over-polymerization during printing or residual resin remaining on the aligner surface.

Designing aligners in this way shifts the demands of treatment planning to a whole new level. Not only must the clinician or technician understand orthodontic biomechanics deeply—they must also accurately reflect that in the virtual design. The problem? Everything can be made to look perfect on a computer screen. In practice, however, even small inaccuracies in material behavior, fit, or force delivery can completely derail treatment. The more options software introduces for “optimized design,” the more difficult it becomes to predict clinical outcomes reliably—unless supported by precise calibration, high-fidelity simulation models, and robust clinical validation.\nThis disconnect between virtual planning and real-world results is currently one of the greatest barriers to using 3D-printed aligners safely and effectively.\n3. Software Not Yet Designed for Printing\nAnother critical issue is that current aligner software systems are primarily built around the thermoforming model. They are designed to generate a sequence of 3D models that are then used to vacuum-form clear plastic sheets into aligners. These systems do not yet support design as if the aligner will be printed directly.\nIn a direct-print workflow, the aligner itself becomes the product—not a mold or model.
