The longer the better.\u00a0If the patient is satisfied with the treatment then you still use the retention protocol.\u00a0The aligner can be used as a retainer, for a couple of months before changing to an aligner retainer. I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsMeet Helle & Jesper Hatt at Swedental at Dentatus on November 13 - 15Get\u00a0the opportunity to buy a signed copy.\u00a0Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life.

One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month.

I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.\u00a0If you see air between the teeth more than 1 mm, then you can try to cut these teeth out of the aligner, and the patient can wear a segmented aligner for 4-6 weeks. Then do a new scan for retainers.\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General Dentists\u00a0Can be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

The longer the better.\u00a0If the patient is satisfied with the treatment then you still use the retention protocol.\u00a0The aligner can be used as a retainer, for a couple of months before changing to an aligner retainer. I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsMeet Helle & Jesper Hatt at Swedental at Dentatus on November 13 - 15Get\u00a0the opportunity to buy a signed copy.\u00a0Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.If you see air between the teeth more than 1 mm, then you can try to cut these teeth out of the aligner, and the patient can wear a segmented aligner for 4-6 weeks. Then do a new scan for retainers.I hope this helps.Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsCan be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1SKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDSHelle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------DisclaimerAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

It can be that there is air the first couple of days. That is when it is really important that the patient bites on the aligner. Use the back en of a toothbrush for help.\u00a0My recommended wearing schedule.In the beginning the aligners should be worn for two weeks. We need to get the biology, the bone remodelling started and that takes 3-4 weeks, and we do not want to be to far a head in the treatment at that point and risk tracking issues already.After a couple of month evaluate to se if everything is tracking and also that the patient has the feeling that the aligners are getting loose after 7-10 day. you can now change the wear time to 7 days.I have attache a guide with tips and tricks to start a ClearCorrect treatment.\u00a0Please let me know if you have any questions.\u00a0Our new mail address for collaborator search is: TPS@AlignerService.com\u00a0Collaborator name is AlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclamer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practicing dentists and their teams.

The longer the better.\u00a0If the patient is satisfied with the treatment then you still use the retention protocol.\u00a0The aligner can be used as a retainer, for a couple of months before changing to an aligner retainer. I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsMeet Helle & Jesper Hatt at Swedental at Dentatus on November 13 - 15Get\u00a0the opportunity to buy a signed copy.\u00a0Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.\u00a0What is important to check is if you and the patient are satisfied with the aesthetic appearance and the functional occlusion (however that can need settling hens the first 3 months retainer with the aligner or a retainer from the last setup stage and not a scan).\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.\u00a0If you see air between the teeth more than 1 mm, then you can try to cut these teeth out of the aligner, and the patient can wear a segmented aligner for 4-6 weeks. Then do a new scan for retainers.\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General Dentists\u00a0Can be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life.

One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month.

I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.If you see air between the teeth more than 1 mm, then you can try to cut these teeth out of the aligner, and the patient can wear a segmented aligner for 4-6 weeks. Then do a new scan for retainers.I hope this helps.Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsCan be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1SKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDSHelle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------DisclaimerAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

The longer the better.\u00a0If the patient is satisfied with the treatment then you still use the retention protocol.\u00a0The aligner can be used as a retainer, for a couple of months before changing to an aligner retainer. I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsMeet Helle & Jesper Hatt at Swedental at Dentatus on November 13 - 15Get\u00a0the opportunity to buy a signed copy.\u00a0Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

We need to get the biology, the bone remodelling started and that takes 3-4 weeks, and we do not want to be to far a head in the treatment at that point and risk tracking issues already.After a couple of month evaluate to se if everything is tracking and also that the patient has the feeling that the aligners are getting loose after 7-10 day. you can now change the wear time to 7 days.I have attache a guide with tips and tricks to start a ClearCorrect treatment.\u00a0Please let me know if you have any questions.\u00a0Our new mail address for collaborator search is: TPS@AlignerService.com\u00a0Collaborator name is AlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclamer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practicing dentists and their teams.

The easiest is to order them at a lab where you send in a scan they can make it from.My retainer protocol is as follows\u00a0The aligner can be used as a retainer, for a couple of months before changing to an aligner retainer. I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear, and after that nighttime wear for the rest of your life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel tighter, then it is time to change to a new set.For a bonded retainer, you need to make sure that there hasn't been a lot of posterior movements, otherwise, they will have a risk of relapse.I will let you know when the setup is ready for your approval.Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsCan be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1SKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDSHelle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------DisclaimerAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

The easiest is to order them at a lab where you send in a scan they can make it from.My retainer protocol is as follows\u00a0The aligner can be used as a retainer, for a couple of months before changing to an aligner retainer. I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear, and after that nighttime wear for the rest of your life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel tighter, then it is time to change to a new set.For a bonded retainer, you need to make sure that there hasn't been a lot of posterior movements, otherwise, they will have a risk of relapse.I will let you know when the setup is ready for your approval.Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsCan be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1SKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDSHelle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------DisclaimerAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

The best approach is for you to send me progress photographs towards the end of treatment, and we can review the case together to decide on the most suitable next steps.The simplest option is usually to trim the aligners distal to the 3s and allow for natural settling. Occlusion typically stabilizes within 4\u20136 weeks. However, this depends on the amount of settling required. If more than 1.5 mm of settling is needed, it\u2019s best to add settling elastics in combination with the trimmed aligners.Please let me know if you have any questions.Our new mail address for collaborator search is: helle@alignerservice.comCollaborator name is\u00a0AlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\u00a0Kind regards,Priyanka Cherian\u00a0tps@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.comDisclaimer:AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience, providing clinical advice to practicing dentists and their teams.

Jeg anbefaler fuldtidsbrug af retaineren de f\u00f8rste 3-4 m\u00e5neder efter endt behandling. Derefter 3-4 m\u00e5neder med 16-18 timers brug og derefter natbrug resten\n af livet. Vi ved, at biologien ikke er f\u00e6rdig med at genopbygge knoglen f\u00f8r 6-8 m\u00e5neder efter den sidste tandbev\u00e6gelse. Det er derfor, det er s\u00e5 vigtigt at have skinner p\u00e5 s\u00e5 meget som muligt i starten for at forhindre tilbagefald.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nJeg anbefaler, at man udleverer to s\u00e6t. Et s\u00e6t, som patienten bruger, og et, som patienten tester en gang om m\u00e5neden. Hvis tests\u00e6ttet begynder at f\u00f8les mere stramt, er det tid til at skifte til et nyt s\u00e6t.\n\n\n\nGrunden til at jeg prim\u00e6rt btuger aligner retainer er at en bonded retainer kun holder p\u00e5 fronten.\n\nDvs hvis i kun laver bonded retainer vil de posterior t\u00e6nder flytte sig over tid.\n\n\n\nI kan i princippet s\u00e6tte bonded retainer p\u00e5 lige efter sides skinner har v\u00e6ret brugt 1-2 uger, men jeg vil fortsat bruge aligneren, men s\u00e5 skal den klippes til svarend til den bonded retainer. Jeg f\u00f8ler mig dog mere sikker p\u00e5 at vente med den bonded retainer\n 3-4 m\u00e5neder.\n\n\n\nJeg h\u00e5ber det giver mening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBook release\n\nMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General Dentists\n\n\n\nCan be ordered at:\n\nMastering Aligner Orthodontics\n | AlignerService.com\nOr buy directly on Amazon\n\nhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0\nHelle Hatt DDS\n\n\nHelle@alignerservice.com\nAlignerservice.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\n\nAlignerService\n consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

Jeg anbefaler fuldtidsbrug af retaineren de f\u00f8rste 3-4 m\u00e5neder efter endt behandling. Derefter 3-4 m\u00e5neder med 16-18 timers brug og derefter natbrug resten af livet. Vi ved, at biologien ikke er f\u00e6rdig med at genopbygge knoglen f\u00f8r 6-8 m\u00e5neder efter den sidste tandbev\u00e6gelse. Det er derfor, det er s\u00e5 vigtigt at have skinner p\u00e5 s\u00e5 meget som muligt i starten for at forhindre tilbagefald.\u00a0\u00a0Jeg anbefaler, at man udleverer to s\u00e6t. Et s\u00e6t, som patienten bruger, og et, som patienten tester en gang om m\u00e5neden. Hvis tests\u00e6ttet begynder at f\u00f8les mere stramt, er det tid til at skifte til et nyt s\u00e6t.Grunden til at jeg prim\u00e6rt btuger aligner retainer er at en bonded retainer kun holder p\u00e5 fronten.Dvs hvis i kun laver bonded retainer vil de posterior t\u00e6nder flytte sig over tid.I kan i princippet s\u00e6tte bonded retainer p\u00e5 lige efter sides skinner har v\u00e6ret brugt 1-2 uger, men jeg vil fortsat bruge aligneren, men s\u00e5 skal den klippes til svarend til den bonded retainer. Jeg f\u00f8ler mig dog mere sikker p\u00e5 at vente med den bonded retainer 3-4 m\u00e5neder.Jeg h\u00e5ber det giver mening.Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsCan be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1SKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDSHelle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------DisclaimerAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

Jeg anbefaler fuldtidsbrug af retaineren de f\u00f8rste 3-4 m\u00e5neder efter endt behandling. Derefter 3-4 m\u00e5neder med 16-18 timers brug og derefter natbrug resten\n af livet. Vi ved, at biologien ikke er f\u00e6rdig med at genopbygge knoglen f\u00f8r 6-8 m\u00e5neder efter den sidste tandbev\u00e6gelse. Det er derfor, det er s\u00e5 vigtigt at have skinner p\u00e5 s\u00e5 meget som muligt i starten for at forhindre tilbagefald.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nJeg anbefaler, at man udleverer to s\u00e6t. Et s\u00e6t, som patienten bruger, og et, som patienten tester en gang om m\u00e5neden. Hvis tests\u00e6ttet begynder at f\u00f8les mere stramt, er det tid til at skifte til et nyt s\u00e6t.\n\n\n\nGrunden til at jeg prim\u00e6rt btuger aligner retainer er at en bonded retainer kun holder p\u00e5 fronten.\n\nDvs hvis i kun laver bonded retainer vil de posterior t\u00e6nder flytte sig over tid.\n\n\n\nI kan i princippet s\u00e6tte bonded retainer p\u00e5 lige efter sides skinner har v\u00e6ret brugt 1-2 uger, men jeg vil fortsat bruge aligneren, men s\u00e5 skal den klippes til svarend til den bonded retainer. Jeg f\u00f8ler mig dog mere sikker p\u00e5 at vente med den bonded retainer\n 3-4 m\u00e5neder.\n\n\n\nJeg h\u00e5ber det giver mening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBook release\n\nMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General Dentists\n\n\n\nCan be ordered at:\n\nMastering Aligner Orthodontics\n | AlignerService.com\nOr buy directly on Amazon\n\nhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0\nHelle Hatt DDS\n\n\nHelle@alignerservice.com\nAlignerservice.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\n\nAlignerService\n consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

This will help\n minimize any tracking issues. I also recommend that the patient chews on the aligners using the back end of a toothbrush or chewies three times a day for five minutes to assist with intrusion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBook release\n\nMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General Dentists\n\nMeet Helle & Jesper Hatt at Swedental at Dentatus on November 13 - 15\n\nGet\u00a0the opportunity to buy a signed copy.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0\nHelle Hatt DDS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHelle@alignerservice.com\n\n\nAlignerservice.com\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical\n advice to practising dentists and their teams.

Make sure that the aligners are seated correctly on the engagers to minimise the risk of tracking issues.\n\n\n\nI have attached a guide with tips and tricks to help you work with aligners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease remember to instruct the patient to chew the aligners firmly onto their teeth, including the engagers, and to wear them for at least 22 hours a day. This will help minimize any tracking issues. I also recommend that the patient chews on the aligners\n using the back end of a toothbrush or chewies three times a day for five minutes to assist with the intrusion.\n\n\n\n\nPlease\n let me know if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBook release\n\nMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General Dentists\n\n\n\nCan be ordered at:\n\nMastering Aligner Orthodontics\n | AlignerService.com\nOr buy directly on Amazon\n\nhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0\nHelle Hatt DDS\n\n\nHelle@alignerservice.com\nAlignerservice.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\n\nAlignerService\n consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

Sie hat zun\u00e4chst eine gute Okklusion und eine Gingivarezession, die noch schlimmer wird, wenn wir versuchen zu distalisieren.Der Biss in Q1 sieht in einer vollen KL II sehr stabil aus, was auch gegen eine Korrektur spricht. Es wird zu einer instabilen Okklusion f\u00fchren, weil wir nicht in der Lage sein werden, eine volle KL I zu erreichen. es wird die obere Mittellinie verschieben und einen Kreuzbiss in der Front erzeugen.Ich empfehle nicht, die Z\u00e4hne zu stark zur\u00fcckzuziehen, nur um die L\u00fccken zu schlie\u00dfen. Das w\u00fcrde den Platz f\u00fcr die Zunge beeintr\u00e4chtigen und zu Schlafapnoe f\u00fchren.In diesem Fall empfehle ich, im Unterkiefer etwas Platz zu lassen, um den \u00dcberbiss zu verkleinern, und dann die Z\u00e4hne zu restaurieren sowie die obere Front zu sanieren.Ich hoffe, das macht Sinn.Bitte lass mich wissen, wenn du irgendwelche Fragen hast.Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsCan be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1SKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDSHelle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------DisclaimerAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

The patient presents with an overjet of 11.97 mm at\n the start of treatment. Extracting in the lower arch would increase the overjet further, so significant IPR is needed in the upper arch to reduce it.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf you prefer an extraction approach, removing #41 instead of #42 may allow easier space closure. Please avoid labial root movements\n on teeth with gingival recession (e.g., lower incisors, #23 etc). IPR should be limited to 0.3 mm in the upper anteriors and 0.5 mm distal to the canines to improve anterior aesthetics.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTreatment is expected to take around 11 months, with 2\u20133 additional aligners.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlternatively, you can request a plan without extraction & correction of crowding using labial crown torque and IPR instead in lower\n anteriors. Please request no labial root movements in the lower anteriors to prevent worsening recession. IPR in the upper arch would still be required.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLet us know if you\u2019d like support optimizing the setup\u2014we\u2019re happy to coordinate with the technicians.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\u00e6re Karin,\n\n\u00a0\nTak for din e-mail.\n\n\u00a0\nCase ID#38474 er moderat til kompleks, afh\u00e6ngigt\n af de aspekter, du \u00f8nsker at behandle. Patienten har et overjet p\u00e5 11,97 mm ved behandlingens start. Ekstraktion i den nedre tandbue vil \u00f8ge overjet yderligere, s\u00e5 der er brug for betydelig IPR i den \u00f8vre tandbue for at reducere det.\n\n\u00a0\nHvis du foretr\u00e6kker en ekstraktionsmetode, kan\n det v\u00e6re lettere at lukke pladsen ved at fjerne nr. 41 i stedet for nr. 42. Undg\u00e5 labiale rodbev\u00e6gelser p\u00e5 t\u00e6nder med gingival recession (f.eks. nedre fort\u00e6nder, #23). IPR b\u00f8r begr\u00e6nses til 0,3 mm i de \u00f8vre anteriorer og 0,5 mm distalt for hj\u00f8rnet\u00e6nderne for\n at forbedre den anteriore \u00e6stetik.\n\n\u00a0\nBehandlingen forventes at tage omkring 11 m\u00e5neder\n med 2-3 ekstra aligners.\n\n\u00a0\nAlternativt kan du anmode om en plan uden ekstraktion\n og korrektion af tr\u00e6ngsel ved hj\u00e6lp af labial kronedrejning og IPR i stedet i nedre anteriorer. Anmod venligst om ingen labiale rodbev\u00e6gelser i de nedre anteriorer for at forhindre forv\u00e6rring af recession.

Extracting in the lower arch would increase the overjet further, so significant IPR is needed in the upper arch to reduce it.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf you prefer an extraction approach, removing #41 instead of #42 may allow easier space closure. Please avoid labial root\n movements on teeth with gingival recession (e.g., lower incisors, #23 etc). IPR should be limited to 0.3 mm in the upper anteriors and 0.5 mm distal to the canines to improve anterior aesthetics.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTreatment is expected to take around 11 months, with 2\u20133 additional aligners.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlternatively, you can request a plan without extraction & correction of crowding using labial crown torque and IPR instead\n in lower anteriors. Please request no labial root movements in the lower anteriors to prevent worsening recession. IPR in the upper arch would still be required.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLet us know if you\u2019d like support optimizing the setup\u2014we\u2019re happy to coordinate with the technicians.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\u00e6re Karin,\n\n\u00a0\nTak for din e-mail.\n\n\u00a0\nCase ID#38474 er moderat til\n kompleks, afh\u00e6ngigt af de aspekter, du \u00f8nsker at behandle. Patienten har et overjet p\u00e5 11,97 mm ved behandlingens start.

The patient presents with an overjet of 11.97 mm at\n the start of treatment. Extracting in the lower arch would increase the overjet further, so significant IPR is needed in the upper arch to reduce it.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf you prefer an extraction approach, removing #41 instead of #42 may allow easier space closure. Please avoid labial root movements\n on teeth with gingival recession (e.g., lower incisors, #23 etc). IPR should be limited to 0.3 mm in the upper anteriors and 0.5 mm distal to the canines to improve anterior aesthetics.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTreatment is expected to take around 11 months, with 2\u20133 additional aligners.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlternatively, you can request a plan without extraction & correction of crowding using labial crown torque and IPR instead in lower\n anteriors. Please request no labial root movements in the lower anteriors to prevent worsening recession. IPR in the upper arch would still be required.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLet us know if you\u2019d like support optimizing the setup\u2014we\u2019re happy to coordinate with the technicians.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\u00e6re Karin,\n\n\u00a0\nTak for din e-mail.\n\n\u00a0\nCase ID#38474 er moderat til kompleks, afh\u00e6ngigt\n af de aspekter, du \u00f8nsker at behandle. Patienten har et overjet p\u00e5 11,97 mm ved behandlingens start. Ekstraktion i den nedre tandbue vil \u00f8ge overjet yderligere, s\u00e5 der er brug for betydelig IPR i den \u00f8vre tandbue for at reducere det.\n\n\u00a0\nHvis du foretr\u00e6kker en ekstraktionsmetode, kan\n det v\u00e6re lettere at lukke pladsen ved at fjerne nr. 41 i stedet for nr. 42. Undg\u00e5 labiale rodbev\u00e6gelser p\u00e5 t\u00e6nder med gingival recession (f.eks. nedre fort\u00e6nder, #23). IPR b\u00f8r begr\u00e6nses til 0,3 mm i de \u00f8vre anteriorer og 0,5 mm distalt for hj\u00f8rnet\u00e6nderne for\n at forbedre den anteriore \u00e6stetik.\n\n\u00a0\nBehandlingen forventes at tage omkring 11 m\u00e5neder\n med 2-3 ekstra aligners.\n\n\u00a0\nAlternativt kan du anmode om en plan uden ekstraktion\n og korrektion af tr\u00e6ngsel ved hj\u00e6lp af labial kronedrejning og IPR i stedet i nedre anteriorer. Anmod venligst om ingen labiale rodbev\u00e6gelser i de nedre anteriorer for at forhindre forv\u00e6rring af recession.

Das macht den Fall vorhersehbarer.\nIch sehe die Aufrichtung von 32, 42 als\n                        gr\u00f6\u00dftes Problem aufgrund der vielen\n                        Wurzelbewegungen.\nIch denke, dass eine ASR im oberen Bogen\n                        erforderlich ist, um sicherzustellen, dass der\n                        \u00dcberbiss nicht zu gro\u00df wird, und im unteren\n                        Bogen, das Risiko von Zahnfleischr\u00fcckg\u00e4ngen zu\n                        verringern.\n\n\nJa, ich denke, dass das Setup ge\u00e4ndert werden\n                        muss.\n\n\nBitte lassen Sie mich wissen, ob ich das\n                        Setup optimieren soll oder ob Sie noch Fragen\n                        haben.\n\n\nBook

To make the movement more predictable, you can make the movement slower (more aligners), and for 23, I would add a bigger engager as well that increases the grip of the aligners to the tooth and then increases the predictability.The read triangles will still be there, but you know that the clinical predictability has been increased, and you should still look out for tracking issues and the risk of revisions.\u00a0In general, the setup needs engagers for some of the big movements, some movements need to be optimised to be more predictable. There are recessions in the upper arch that, with this setup, will increase, so that also needs to be taken into account if you want to avoid that.\u00a0If you need us to help you optimise and modify the setup, we will be happy to take over the communications with the technicians.We charge a fee for this service.\u00a0I have attached our price list if you are interested in this.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if you have any questions.\u00a0Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General Dentists\u00a0Can be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

Given how small the dental world is, I am not too comfortable having conversations with dentists accredited in Invisalign by the ADA to encourage them to take up our TPS.That said, I certainly want to boost the number of Aligner service cases. I have a suggestion \u2014 please feel free to disregard it if you feel it\u2019s too radical.Perhaps we could run a limited-time offer during a week in May when the entire TPS team is available (for example, the week of May 11th). Dentists would be invited to pay whatever price they feel is fair for the service on two cases. We could promote this to a group, maybe a part of the list of 1,000 UK dentists I shared with you earlier.This idea is inspired by a restaurant model where no prices are listed on the menu, and customers are asked to pay what they feel is appropriate for the meal/service they received. The owner reported that hardly people took advantage of the system, and most customers ended up paying amounts similar to or more than what would have been the listed prices.It could also serve as a market assessment to gauge what price dentists are comfortable paying for TPS, helping us in future pricing decisions and discount campaigns.Please let me know your thoughts.Kind regards,Priyanka'\nAgent replied: 'Dear\u00a0\u00a0Priyanka CherianThank you for your mail.\u00a0\u00a0will get back to you as soon as possible if a response is needed.Thank you for your patience.Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Tps@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com'",

Please note that the incisal wear on tooth #21 has become more prominent, which will benefit\n from restorative correction following orthodontic treatment.\n\n\nKindly keep an eye on the movements of teeth #14, #12, and #42. It\u2019s important to ensure that the engagers are properly seated in the aligners\n to minimize the risk of tracking issues.\n\n\nPlease also remind the patient to bite down firmly on the aligners\u2014particularly over the engagers\u2014and to wear them for a minimum of 22 hours per\n day. This will help maintain optimal tracking throughout treatment.\n\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\u00e6re Anne-Birgitte,\n\n\nOps\u00e6tningen for case #2091721 er nu klar til din godkendelse.\n\n\nDer er planlagt en \u00e6stetisk justering af dette tilf\u00e6lde. Bem\u00e6rk venligst, at det incisale slid p\u00e5 tand nr. 21 er blevet mere fremtr\u00e6dende,\n hvilket vil have gavn af en restaurativ korrektion efter den ortodontiske behandling.\n\n\nHold venligst \u00f8je med bev\u00e6gelserne af tand nr. 14, 12 og 42. Det er vigtigt at sikre, at engagers sidder korrekt i alignerne for\n at minimere risikoen for sporingsproblemer.\n\n\nMind ogs\u00e5 patienten om at bide godt fast i alignerne - is\u00e6r over engagementerne - og at have dem p\u00e5 i mindst 22 timer om dagen.\n Dette vil hj\u00e6lpe med at opretholde optimal sporing under hele behandlingen.\n\n\nDu er velkommen til at kontakte os, hvis du har sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l.\n\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur\n new mail address for collaborator search is: helle@alignerservice.com\nCollaborator\n name is\u00a0AlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind\n regards,\n\nPriyanka Cherian\u00a0\ntps@alignerservice.com\nAlignerservice.com\nDisclaimer:\n\n\nAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists\n with extensive clear aligner experience, providing clinical advice to practicing dentists and their teams.

Please note that the incisal wear on tooth #21 has become more prominent, which will benefit\n from restorative correction following orthodontic treatment.\n\n\nKindly keep an eye on the movements of teeth #14, #12, and #42. It\u2019s important to ensure that the engagers are properly seated in the aligners\n to minimize the risk of tracking issues.\n\n\nPlease also remind the patient to bite down firmly on the aligners\u2014particularly over the engagers\u2014and to wear them for a minimum of 22 hours per\n day. This will help maintain optimal tracking throughout treatment.\n\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\u00e6re Anne-Birgitte,\n\n\nOps\u00e6tningen for case #2091721 er nu klar til din godkendelse.\n\n\nDer er planlagt en \u00e6stetisk justering af dette tilf\u00e6lde. Bem\u00e6rk venligst, at det incisale slid p\u00e5 tand nr. 21 er blevet mere fremtr\u00e6dende,\n hvilket vil have gavn af en restaurativ korrektion efter den ortodontiske behandling.\n\n\nHold venligst \u00f8je med bev\u00e6gelserne af tand nr. 14, 12 og 42. Det er vigtigt at sikre, at engagers sidder korrekt i alignerne for at minimere\n risikoen for sporingsproblemer.\n\n\nMind ogs\u00e5 patienten om at bide godt fast i alignerne - is\u00e6r over engagementerne - og at have dem p\u00e5 i mindst 22 timer om dagen. Dette\n vil hj\u00e6lpe med at opretholde optimal sporing under hele behandlingen.\n\n\nDu er velkommen til at kontakte os, hvis du har sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l.\n\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur\n new mail address for collaborator search is: helle@alignerservice.com\nCollaborator\n name is\u00a0AlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind\n regards,\n\nPriyanka Cherian\u00a0\ntps@alignerservice.com\nAlignerservice.com\nDisclaimer:\n\n\nAlignerService consists of dentists\n and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience, providing clinical advice to practicing dentists and their teams.

Please note that the incisal wear on tooth #21 has become more prominent, which will benefit\n from restorative correction following orthodontic treatment.\n\n\nKindly keep an eye on the movements of teeth #14, #12, and #42. It\u2019s important to ensure that the engagers are properly seated in the aligners\n to minimize the risk of tracking issues.\n\n\nPlease also remind the patient to bite down firmly on the aligners\u2014particularly over the engagers\u2014and to wear them for a minimum of 22 hours per\n day. This will help maintain optimal tracking throughout treatment.\n\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\u00e6re Anne-Birgitte,\n\n\nOps\u00e6tningen for case #2091721 er nu klar til din godkendelse.\n\n\nDer er planlagt en \u00e6stetisk justering af dette tilf\u00e6lde. Bem\u00e6rk venligst, at det incisale slid p\u00e5 tand nr. 21 er blevet mere fremtr\u00e6dende,\n hvilket vil have gavn af en restaurativ korrektion efter den ortodontiske behandling.\n\n\nHold venligst \u00f8je med bev\u00e6gelserne af tand nr. 14, 12 og 42. Det er vigtigt at sikre, at engagers sidder korrekt i alignerne for at minimere\n risikoen for sporingsproblemer.\n\n\nMind ogs\u00e5 patienten om at bide godt fast i alignerne - is\u00e6r over engagementerne - og at have dem p\u00e5 i mindst 22 timer om dagen. Dette\n vil hj\u00e6lpe med at opretholde optimal sporing under hele behandlingen.\n\n\nDu er velkommen til at kontakte os, hvis du har sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l.\n\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur\n new mail address for collaborator search is: helle@alignerservice.com\nCollaborator\n name is\u00a0AlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind\n regards,\n\nPriyanka Cherian\u00a0\ntps@alignerservice.com\nAlignerservice.com\nDisclaimer:\n\n\nAlignerService consists of dentists\n and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience, providing clinical advice to practicing dentists and their teams.

Please note that the incisal wear on tooth #21 has become more\n prominent, which will benefit from restorative correction following orthodontic treatment.\n\n\nKindly keep an eye on the movements of teeth #14, #12, and #42. It\u2019s important to ensure that the engagers are properly\n seated in the aligners to minimize the risk of tracking issues.\n\n\nPlease also remind the patient to bite down firmly on the aligners\u2014particularly over the engagers\u2014and to wear them\n for a minimum of 22 hours per day. This will help maintain optimal tracking throughout treatment.\n\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\u00e6re Anne-Birgitte,\n\n\n\n\nOps\u00e6tningen for case #2091721 er nu klar til din godkendelse.\n\n\n\n\nDer er planlagt en \u00e6stetisk justering af dette tilf\u00e6lde. Bem\u00e6rk venligst, at det incisale slid p\u00e5 tand nr. 21 er blevet mere fremtr\u00e6dende, hvilket vil have gavn af en restaurativ korrektion efter den ortodontiske behandling.\n\n\n\n\nHold venligst \u00f8je med bev\u00e6gelserne af tand nr. 14, 12 og 42. Det er vigtigt at sikre, at engagers sidder korrekt i alignerne for at minimere risikoen for sporingsproblemer.\n\n\n\n\nMind ogs\u00e5 patienten om at bide godt fast i alignerne - is\u00e6r over engagementerne - og at have dem p\u00e5 i mindst 22 timer om dagen. Dette vil hj\u00e6lpe med at opretholde optimal sporing under hele behandlingen.\n\n\n\n\nDu er velkommen til at kontakte os, hvis du har sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l.\n\n\n\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur new mail address for collaborator search is: helle@alignerservice.com\nCollaborator name is\nAlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\nPriyanka Cherian\u00a0\ntps@alignerservice.com\nAlignerservice.com\nDisclaimer:\n\n\nAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience, providing clinical advice to practicing\n dentists and their teams.

For efficient orthodontic tooth movement, we typically recommend:1\u00b0 per aligner for tipping/torquing2\u00b0 per aligner for rotation0.2 mm per aligner for translation (intrusion, extrusion, or labial/lingual movement)While teeth can be digitally aligned faster, biological constraints like bone remodeling often cannot keep up, leading to loss of tracking and the need for additional aligners.If needed, treatment could be stopped at 12 aligners. In that case, some aesthetic alignment may remain unfinished, but the occlusion and canine guidance would already be properly established, making it a clinically acceptable point to stop.Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to adjust the plan.Our new mail address for collaborator search is: helle@alignerservice.comCollaborator name is\u00a0AlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\u00a0Kind regards,Priyanka Cherian\u00a0tps@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.comDisclaimer:AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience, providing clinical advice to practicing dentists and their teams.

Occlusal contacts have been intentionally avoided on the incisors to prevent premature anterior contact, which could increase the risk of a posterior open bite.\n\n\nAn overbite of 2\u202fmm is present at the end of treatment. Due to incisal wear and the rounded shape of the incisors\u2014especially the lateral incisors\u2014it may give the impression of an open bite. I would recommend keeping it as planned, as the intrusion\n planned on the lower anteriors is unlikely to fully track. The setup slightly over-engineers the movement, so the actual overbite may end up deeper than 2\u202fmm, which should help resolve the issue.\n\n\nThe open gingival embrasure between teeth 12 and 11 appears more prominent in the digital setup. This is because setups do not accurately predict the gingival response\u2014so the \"black triangles\" may not be as noticeable clinically.

This will help minimize any tracking problems.\n\u00a0\nAt every recall appointment, please check the interproximal contacts of teeth planned for movement using dental floss to confirm there\n is enough space for effective tracking.

The teeth were originally aligned to the incisal margins, but since restorative treatment is planned post-alignment and the patient has a gummy smile, I will align the teeth to the gingival margins. Final alignment to the incisal edges can then be achieved with the restorative work.Here are some measurements to note:UR1 is 8.10 mm and UL1 is 8.33 mm \u2014 0.23 mm needs to be added to UL1.UR2 is 7.06 mm and UL2 is 7.30 mm \u2014 0.24 mm needs to be added to UR2.UR3 is 7.20 mm and UL3 is 7.19 mm \u2014 these are nearly identical.The remaining residual space will be distributed in the left quadrant.I will modify the case accordingly and will be in touch as soon as it is ready for approval.Please let me know if you have any questions.Our new mail address for collaborator search is: helle@alignerservice.comCollaborator name is\u00a0AlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\u00a0Kind regards,Priyanka Cherian\u00a0tps@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.comDisclaimer:AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience, providing clinical advice to practicing dentists and their teams.

The upper midline has also been planned for improvement.Please pay close attention to the movements on teeth #7, 9, 2, and 3. It\u2019s important to ensure that the attachments are properly seated within the aligners to minimize the risk of tracking issues.Kindly remind the patient to chew the aligners firmly onto the teeth, including over the attachments, and to wear them for a minimum of 22 hours per day.

The teeth were originally aligned to the incisal margins, but since restorative treatment is planned post-alignment and the patient has a gummy smile, I will align the teeth to the gingival margins. Final alignment to the incisal edges can then be achieved with the restorative work.Here are some measurements to note:UR1 is 8.10 mm and UL1 is 8.33 mm \u2014 0.23 mm needs to be added to UL1.UR2 is 7.06 mm and UL2 is 7.30 mm \u2014 0.24 mm needs to be added to UR2.UR3 is 7.20 mm and UL3 is 7.19 mm \u2014 these are nearly identical.The remaining residual space will be distributed in the left quadrant.I will modify the case accordingly and will be in touch as soon as it is ready for approval.Please let me know if you have any questions.Our new mail address for collaborator search is: helle@alignerservice.comCollaborator name is\u00a0AlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\u00a0Kind regards,Priyanka Cherian\u00a0tps@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.comDisclaimer:AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience, providing clinical advice to practicing dentists and their teams.

They are meant to tighten the contact points. If the contact points are fine, you should not use the last two stages.There are a lot of big rotations there has a high risk of tracking issues.especially 44,45, I have also on those teeth added lingual engagers to help with the grip from the aligner to the teeth. I have left a little space around those teeth as well to minimise the amount that the lower teeth need to be retracted.When we close the space by lingual retraction, we minimise the space for the tongue. When the tongue has less space, there is a high risk of relapse as well as sleep apnea because then there is only one way for the tongue to go, and that is back.I hope it makes sense.Please remember to instruct the patient to chew the aligners firmly onto their teeth, including the engagers, and to wear them for at least 22 hours a day. This will help minimise any tracking issues. I also recommend that the patient chews on the aligners using the back end of a toothbrush or chewies three times a day for five minutes to assist with the intrusion.Please let me know if you have any questions.Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsCan be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1SKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDSHelle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------DisclaimerAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear, and after that nighttime wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel tighter then it is time to change to a new set.You can, in principle, remove the engagers when you are done with the last aligner (after two weeks).\u00a0A bonded retainer only retains the front teeth. You also have a lot of posterior movements in the case, so I would not recommend only bonded retainers.Bonded retainers will not prevent the autorotation of the mandible.The mandible should autorotate when the occlusion is changing. If you have a few contact points, you could polish them, and that will increase the autorotation of the mandible.If you need posterior settling for a bitter occlusion, I recommend the bonded retainer in the lower and a Hawley retainer i the upper arch.A fixed retainer could be added straight away.I hope this helps.Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsCan be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1SKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDSHelle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------DisclaimerAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

IPR mainly planned on the lower left side to improve midline alignment as well.Please remember to instruct the patient to chew the aligners firmly onto their teeth, including over the engagers, and to wear the aligners for at least 22 hours per day. This will help minimize any tracking issues.At each recall appointment, please check the inter-proximal contacts of the teeth planned for movement using dental floss to ensure that there is sufficient space and that the movements are tracking properly. If the teeth are experiencing friction from adjacent teeth, tracking may be compromised. If the inter-proximal contacts are too tight, please use a polishing IPR strip (yellow in the color-coded IPR system, with a thickness of 0.08 mm) to relieve the contact points.Please let me know if you have any questions.Our new mail address for collaborator search is: helle@alignerservice.comCollaborator name is\u00a0AlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\u00a0Kind regards,Priyanka Cherian\u00a0tps@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.comDisclaimer:AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience, providing clinical advice to practicing dentists and their teams.

We truly appreciate your insights and understand the expectations you've outlined regarding AI capabilities especially around context-aware response generation and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\nAt present, the Zia AI integration primarily leverages information from the current ticket thread and individual knowledge base (KB) articles to suggest responses. It does not yet support deep contextual synthesis across multiple KB articles or historical tickets. This means that its capabilities are closer to guided suggestions than full generative AI functionality with broad contextual understanding.\nWe understand this may not fully align with your expectations based on the marketing or documentation, and we sincerely apologize for any confusion caused. Our teams are actively working on evolving our AI offerings, and capabilities like RAG-based response generation and deeper contextual learning are areas under consideration for future development.We will get back to you incase of an any update.

Diamond-coated strips or specialised IPR burs can significantly reduce the time needed for each procedure.\n\nPlan Ahead: Before starting the IPR, ensure that you have a clear treatment plan. Use digital tools to visualise the amount of reduction needed for each tooth, which can help streamline the process.\n\nPractice Technique: Familiarise yourself with the IPR technique through training videos or workshops. This can enhance your skill and speed during the procedure.\n\nPatient Preparation: Ensure that your patients are well-informed about the process and comfortable during the procedure. This can help minimise delays and interruptions.\n\nFollow a Step-by-Step Protocol: Implement a consistent protocol for IPR that includes specific steps for each patient. This can help you maintain a steady pace and reduce variability in your approach.\n\nFor materials, you can source IPR strips and burs from dental supply companies or online retailers that specialise in orthodontic tools. Look for products that are specifically designed for clear aligner treatments to ensure compatibility and effectiveness.By optimising your technique and using the right materials, you should be able to achieve a faster and more predictable IPR process.Best regards,\nHelle HattBook releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsCan be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1SKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDSHelle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------DisclaimerAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.
