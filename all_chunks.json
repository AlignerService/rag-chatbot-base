The longer the better.\u00a0If the patient is satisfied with the treatment then you still use the retention protocol.\u00a0The aligner can be used as a retainer, for a couple of months before changing to an aligner retainer. I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsMeet Helle & Jesper Hatt at Swedental at Dentatus on November 13 - 15Get\u00a0the opportunity to buy a signed copy.\u00a0Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement.

One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month.

I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.\u00a0If you see air between the teeth more than 1 mm, then you can try to cut these teeth out of the aligner, and the patient can wear a segmented aligner for 4-6 weeks. Then do a new scan for retainers.\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General Dentists\u00a0Can be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

The longer the better.\u00a0If the patient is satisfied with the treatment then you still use the retention protocol.\u00a0The aligner can be used as a retainer, for a couple of months before changing to an aligner retainer. I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsMeet Helle & Jesper Hatt at Swedental at Dentatus on November 13 - 15Get\u00a0the opportunity to buy a signed copy.\u00a0Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1S\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

I recommend full-time wear of the retainer for the first 3-4 months after finishing the treatment. Then 3-4 months with 16-18 hours wear and after that night time wear for the rest of the life. We know that the biology hasn't finished the bone remodelling before 6-8 months after the last tooth movement. That is why it is really important to have retainers as much as possible in the beginning to prevent relapses.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend handing out two sets. One set that the patient is using and one that the patient tests once a month. If the test set starts to feel more tight then it is time to change to a new set.If you see air between the teeth more than 1 mm, then you can try to cut these teeth out of the aligner, and the patient can wear a segmented aligner for 4-6 weeks. Then do a new scan for retainers.I hope this helps.Book releaseMastering Aligner Orthodontics: A Guide for General DentistsCan be ordered at:Mastering Aligner Orthodontics | AlignerService.comOr buy directly on Amazonhttps://a.co/d/4pXzb1SKind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDSHelle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------DisclaimerAlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practising dentists and their teams.

It can be that there is air the first couple of days. That is when it is really important that the patient bites on the aligner. Use the back en of a toothbrush for help.\u00a0My recommended wearing schedule.In the beginning the aligners should be worn for two weeks. We need to get the biology, the bone remodelling started and that takes 3-4 weeks, and we do not want to be to far a head in the treatment at that point and risk tracking issues already.After a couple of month evaluate to se if everything is tracking and also that the patient has the feeling that the aligners are getting loose after 7-10 day. you can now change the wear time to 7 days.I have attache a guide with tips and tricks to start a ClearCorrect treatment.\u00a0Please let me know if you have any questions.\u00a0Our new mail address for collaborator search is: TPS@AlignerService.com\u00a0Collaborator name is AlignerService Global\u00a0TPS\u00a0\u00a0Kind regards / Venlig hilsen / Mit\u00a0freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\u00a0Helle Hatt DDS\u00a0Helle@alignerservice.comAlignerservice.com\u00a0\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclamer\u00a0AlignerService consists of dentists and orthodontists with extensive clear aligner experience giving clinical advice to practicing dentists and their teams.

Of course I will write in English.\u00a0It would be my pleasure to help with this case.It would be a good idea to expand to give the patient a wider smile.If the HOB is to be minimised much more, it will require sequential distalisation with KL II elastics. This will flatten the patient's profile a bit more, and the upper lip will fall down a bit to cover more of the OK teeth.I'm not sure it is appropriate for this patient to distalise to improve HOB, and it could also be that the patient is not interested in a straighter profile.
